This is a little wafer of a park on the shores of twin lake. There are some questionable residences in the general area, so don't go night caching here. The park is full of trash and grafitti. In the winter, it is torn up by snowmobiles, in the summer, it is a breeding ground for ticks and mosquitos. And yet, kids ply the banks of the feeder creeks fishing for sunnies, carp and amphibians, and most undoubtedly wind up on a plate. A bench here, a picnic tale there and one bridge that serves very little purpose.  &lt;p&gt;

The old Camp Snoopy is now Nickelodeon Universe.&lt;br /&gt;
Today, this would be listed as a puzzle cache but not back when it
was first approved.
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located behind a checkout counter at a
participating store in the Mall of America. You must solve the
puzzle below to figure out the address or location of the
participating store. Once you figure out the puzzle, go to the
store and ask the cashier (or is it cache_ier) for the Mall of
America Geocache. If they appear new to this, ask them to call
their manager to ask about it. Please then be respectful and move
clear of the cashier so that they may efficiently help their other
customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each store in the mall has an individual address or location. A
list of every store's address can be found in the official Map
&amp;amp; Directory of the Mall of America. These maps are available by
each entrance. Each address has a letter of the alphabet, and a
number to identify the store's location on the map. The letters
represent north, south, east, and west. This particular store has a
letter, and a three digit number. For example, the Gap Kids store
has an address of S160. The S is for south. The number is what you
can use to find the location of the store on the map. Use the clues
below to figure out the address of this participating store with
the geocache. You do not have to purchase anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can determine whether the store is located on the North,
East, South or West side of the mall by locating the mosaic tiles
in the floor (not in Nickelodean Universe) that look like
these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/e6eb9577-533a-42e6-af88-9e01c16ad650.jpg" /&gt;

 &lt;img src=

 &lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/bed8908a-bb4d-45df-9fc5-6b06cf5a7780.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/417015a2-9b4e-4b90-bec6-56c1520e115c.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/151f7ba1-d059-435f-93c5-b1fb414e0b45.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The store is on the same side of the mall as these
mosaics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the store address is a number with three
digit places in it. In the example above, S160, 1 is the hundreds
digit,6 is the tens digit, and 0 is the ones digit. You will find
that all of the clues for the digits are located in Nickelodean
Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;font color='red' size='4'&gt;The Hundreds Digit:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the number of gondolas on Dora's el Circulo del Cielo, and
subtract from that number the number seats in the Avatar Airbender.
The number you come up with will go in the hundreds digit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color='red' size='4'&gt;The Tens Digit:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the number of big orange pillars at nustuff and subtract
from that the number of seats in one "car" on the Fairly Odd
Coaster. This number will be in the tens digit place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color='red' size='4'&gt;The Ones Digit:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the number of seats in one "car" of the Rock Bottom Plunge
and subtract from that number the number of cars in the Swiper's
Sweeper ride. This number will be the ones digit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now have the address that you will need to find the
cache. Politely ask for it from the cashier. Please remember to
move out of their way so that they may help other customers
efficiently. Let the cashier know what you are trading, and also
what you are taking from the cache so they don't think you are
walking out of the store with their inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this tour of the Mall of America and
Nickelodean Universe theme park. Send me an email if any of this
does not make sense or if it is confusing. Thanks, TECGeoJim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note on trackables: Since this cache is visited by many people
on vacation who may not log the cache on-line until they get home,
the on-line inventory of trackables is often out-of-date.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Apparently we can't count something correctly because we had to use a PAF when we couldn't find any store with the number we can up with. Ours tens digit was off by one. Thanks for the cache, we have a lot of fun walking the park before the flash mob and solving (almost) the puzzle.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">After seeing my cache near the lake getting constantly plundered, I've decided to relocate.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">O.K. This spot has less naked creeps, more privacy, and is much less likely to be plundered. When you hunt for this cache, please look for good pieces of bark to bring along with you to assist in re-hiding this cache. Let me know if it starts to look exposed. As with the now archived "Neglected Parks 2", the best parking is at Schaper park. Don't park in the lots of local businesses. They tow. There is a legal access with street parking north and east of the cache. Access is roughly N44.59.502 W093.19.948

Cache is an ammo can. It is newly painted in camoflage colors, and has a Geocache sticker on it. Once again, I forgot to put a "So you found it" document in it. Please bring one with if you think you will be first. 

Cache contains the usual Irvingdog goodies.

Please, please, please, move away from the cache site to to go through the box. It is a heavily used area. For optimum enjoyment during the hunt, try to use only the trails until within 50 feet. More twists and turns than a good mystery novel.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A boy in Brooklyn Park was always on his bike, going off to
adventure. We'd bike down to Earle Brown's farm, a thousand-acre
ranch that lay along Highway 100, white face cattle grazing on a
treeless plain, with Mr. Brown's big house, barns, stables, and
riding arena in the distance. Earle Brown had been sheriff in
Hennepin County and apparently he had the same cowboy fantasies
that we had; his farm looked for all the world like a piece of
Texas. &lt;b&gt;We'd bike up 77th to a deserted grass airstrip, Victory
Memorial Field, left over from World War I, where rusting planes
sat in a big silent hangar.&lt;/b&gt; We'd climb into the cockpits and
I'd imagined soaring and roaring through the cloudbanks over the
Rhine blasting Nazi Messerschmidts out of the sky.&lt;br /&gt;

constructed?&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;font color="red"&gt;PLEASE NOTE THE GC.COM RULE THAT THE PHYSICAL
SITE OF A VIRTUAL CACHE MUST BE VISITED IN ORDER TO LOG THE FIND. I
had to delete logs from people who almost certainly did not visit
the physical site. I will continue to check each log to verify that
the finder appears to have visited the physical site, and if it is
highly likely that you did not, your log will be deleted, even if
you answer the question correctly. In order to have a fair playing
field, everybody in the game needs to follow the same rules.&lt;/font&gt;

      Alexandria, MN is one of the toughest stops on the Minnesota
      Junior Bowlers Tour, but we always go anyway. In 2002 there
      were about 55 boys and 16 girls. After 5 games Kollin was in
      6th place and Kris was probably 20th. After 9 games Kris was
      in 4th place and Kollin faded to 16th. The top 10 advanced to
      match play, head-to-head competition. Out of 9 opponents,
      Kris beat 7 and tied 1. His one loss was because of a nasty
      split in the 10th frame. A 10th game was bowled for position
      round, and he ended up at +216, a 221.6 average. He was
      dominant throughout match play. The second place finisher was
      +45, a 204.5 average. This was his first win in a major
      tournament. Of the 9 opponents, 4 were previous
      champions.&lt;/font&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In the 1880s, Big Willow was the site of St. Albans Mill, a flour mill located in the north section of the park on Minnehaha Creek and was served by a railroad spur. Later, Adam Hannah was the owner of the property where Big Willow Park and the Minnetonka Public Works facility are now located. He built a home on the site in 1913 for his wife and three children. After his death in 1929, his daughter Mary R. E. Hannah lived in the house until she died in 1967. The city had already purchased some of the property in the 1950s, and acquired the rest after Hannah’s death.</groundspeak:long_description>

Historic District:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;The road we know as Highway
100 was once known by the nickname "Lilac Way". &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;Lilac
Way, named for the lilac bushes that were planted along the
highway, was the brainchild of Carl Graeser, German immigrant and
architect for the Minnesota Highway Department. &amp;nbsp;Graeser is
now known as the "Father of the Beltway" for his dedication to
creating a beltway system around the Twin Cities in the 1920s and
1930s, an idea that was foreign to most people at the time, as the
road does not go "to somewhere" but "around somewhere." &amp;nbsp;
Built during the Great Depression under the leadership of Graeser,
this stretch of Highway 100 between Highway 7 and County Road 81
created many jobs under the Works Progress Administration,
including those of the stonemasons who built the sturdy park
tables, grills and walls. &amp;nbsp;Because this was still a rural area
at the time, the highway became known as a leisure drive, where
families could drive through in the Spring and see the lilac bushes
in bloom, stopping at the five roadside parks for lunch or to just
relax, a far cry from the bumper to bumper headache it has become
today. &amp;nbsp;For more information on Lilac Way and its history,
check out this &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

&amp;nbsp;This park is eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places, but I don't know if it will be preserved in this location
when construction inevitably starts here. &amp;nbsp;I do know that
Graeser Park at 100 and Cty 81 will be refurbished once
construction is complete. &amp;nbsp;There is already a cache at that

it is. Located in Heritage Park in the City of Plymouth. You
shouldn't have any problem loacting this one. It is the largest

Travel Bugs. I only ask that if you grab one, Drop one. Please do
not completely empty it out. Trade for a different one, or only
take one. You may visit this one once, then post notes for future
visits. Thanks and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

This monument is dedicated to those who lost their lives trying to
run from this fire, there are many trees in the area that still

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Duluth/Superior area (or sorry to hear you're leaving Duluth)!&lt;br&gt;This should be a fairly easy to get to cache that can be accessed from the Thompson Hill Rest Area.  It's a whole 300' or so from the parking lot.  A good chance to stop and stretch your legs.&lt;br&gt;Thompson Hill offers a great view of Duluth and Superior.  Be sure to go inside and check out the information center.&lt;br&gt;I've had a number of bugs in my hands recently that needed to leave the area, but I've not had a good place to drop them to get them on their way.  Hopefully this will do it.  This is a travel bug hotel for bugs coming into the area or leaving the area.  Be sure to write the bugs destination in the log book so others will know where it is going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would appreciate it if you swap bugs one for one but please take a bug if you feel that you can help it along to it's destination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don't have a TB to swap then you are welcome to TNLN or take something else from the cache and leave something else.  I have started the cache out with a couple of bugs and a couple of other items to trade.  The container is a smaller ammo box.  This container should easily fit most TBs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've marked the cache as winter friendly as it is often found in the winter although you may end up digging a little bit for it if there's been a lot of snow.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;font color="black"&gt;Magic Squares can be fun. Especially if you
know how.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;They look like this......&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;img width="350" src=

&lt;br&gt;
 and can be virtually any size square.&lt;br&gt;
 The 3x3 has 8 possible solutions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The given coordinated are a good parking spot south of the
technical school by the ball fields. Parking at 45:6.11829 by
-93:22.302 is better. Plenty of residential parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to this cache you will have to complete the Magic
Squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;-B2A1:X4X4.Y6C2X6Y5&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the area as much as I did. You are searching
for a tin can aprox. 3.5" round by 5.5" tall. There is a log book a
pencil and a couple of trade items. Plenty of room for more or a
travel bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;And as of 8 April 2005 there is a NEW Camo'ed container waiting

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">An easy three stage micro multi-cache along Cortlawn Pond in Golden Valley. It is a flat, and easy walk between the three stages. All are winter friendly. 

Go to the first stage at the above posted coordinates which happens to be a good and legal place to park.(Please don't park in any of the local businesses-they tow!)  There are some words on a sign. What does it say you are supposed to look for? Take that word and using standard ROT-13 encryption determine the new encrypted word. Next, add up the letters using A=1, B=2, C=3...Z=26.
Now multiply that answer by the number of letters in that word. Call that total "TOT". The coordinates of the second stage are then:

    N44.58. __ __ __ (TOT+153)
    W93.21. __ __ __ (TOT+285)
 
The second stage will give you the coord's to the final which is a green matchbox. Have fun and enjoy the walk.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OK. So this multi cache took me quite a few times. Many more than it really should have. The first time I went to go and look for it, I hadn't fully read the cache listing page and realized that the first stage was actually a puzzle and not just a simple container. So after spending fifteen or twenty minutes looking for it I gave up (boy didn't I feel like a fool).

The next time I came to try and look for it, I knew what I needed to do. So I started doing all the translations and counting on my fingers (and toes) and realized that there was no way I was doing all the math right. Not to mention the rot13. So I gave up once again and headed home.

Another day I found myself on the other side of this park looking for the final of a local puzzle master's cache and thought to myself, "Self why don't we give this one another try". This time, armed with my handy paper and pencil, I started writing everything down. Once I got everything done I quickly realized that I didn't have time to get over to where stage two was so once again, I skipped it and headed home.

I finally made the intelligent move of putting stage 2 into my gsak database so that when I had a chance I would have it. Well, not so intelligent that I kept my solution from the previous day and I had to calculate stage two again for the third time.

I decided that today was the day, as I drove past the way point and decided to go for it. After a quick u-turn I found my way to ground zero and wandered for five minutes until I finally found the marker.

Trying to save myself some time, I decided to drive down the road and park a little closer. It took me longer to decide where to park but finally I found the spot.

When arriving at stage three I was sure this was the final but I found myself at a spot where no container could be. I decided to widen my search zone and noticed something out of the ordinary. Once that was done I quickly found the container and signed the log.

Thanks for a great cache and a fun adventure.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This Cache is name after the wild/domestic turkeys that lurk in
these woods around Bassett creek.&lt;br&gt;
 The turkeys are quite famous in Golden Valley and have sometimes
created quite a nuisance for traffic in the area.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Approach this cache from trails which begin at Vale Crest Road.&lt;br&gt;
Street parking is also available here.&lt;br&gt;
Take the high trail for an easy walk.&lt;br&gt;
Take the low trail for a more challenging, scenic approach. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Cache is a small slim black container, about 2" square by 12"
long.&lt;br&gt;
I have placed several small kid friendly items as well as a log and
pen.&lt;br&gt;
Cache will hold small items only. &lt;br&gt;

Free, legal parking within a stone's throw of the cache is
available at N 44° 51.892 W 093° 24.734 - a nice paved trail
provides wheelchair and foot access from there all the way to the
hide location. After finding this one, be sure to take a stroll
around the lake to find the other caches hidden along this
trail!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As always...thanks, have fun, and happy hunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

We haven't hidden a cache all year and it was starting to wear on me. I had this type of cache in mind for a very long time, but I just didn't ever find the time to hide it. This weekend was a good weekend because it is the 1st anniversary of the caches that we hid in late November last year ("Beeware", "November 20th", "Help!", "Noname", "Thanksgiving Day Cache", "Stairway to Heaven", and "Wood-Rill SNA").

This cache is specifically trying to collect coins from different countries (or U.S.A. if you don't have others). There are already many in there to begin with.

I checked out several spots and then reached the point of no return and retrieved the cache. Looks like its still around and in pretty good shape, though getting a little rusty. Thanks for the cache and knocking off a spot on my d/t matrix.

Annie layed her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons 
in her long brown hair
I don't know, it must have been the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there


I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there


Ten years the waves rolled the 
ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow 
in all good company
if I tell another what 
your own lips told to me
may I lay neath the roses 
and my eyes no longer see


I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there


One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though, 
come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the
ribbons that she wore
and it's strange how no one 
comes round anymore

The area can be very busy in the spring, especially on Satudays, because the site is adjacent to the the City of Hopkins brush drop-off and mulch pick-up site. Take care not to spoil the cache.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">When you are just frazzled from trying to drive the Crosstown along with 20 million others, it’s time to fire up the GPS, get off on the nearest exit and geocache your way back home.  Who needs irritating drivers raising your blood pressure when you can spend the time you’d otherwise be stalled in traffic out in the great outdoors finding meaningless treasures in beautiful places?

There is a small park in Edina called Strachauer Park. It is located on Beard Avenue in Northeast Edina, against the infamous Crosstown Highway.  

The five-acre park features a playground, a full-sized basketball court, ice hockey rink and warming house, and two soccer fields. Strachauer Park is the perfect destination for any active family—especially geocaching.

Seek micro cache, but not so micro that you can’t see it

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This micro cache is 3 x ¾ x ½ inches. Be careful and place the cache back in its original location.

This is a high traffic area at times, so I suggest that you go there on a weekday (morning or early afternoon, before 4:30 PM)  or Sunday morning. No problems in the winter, except for the COLD, which will make the find more difficult.

The hints are vague. If you need more help, record a "Didn't Find It" and let me know that you would like an additional hint. Then I can reduce the difficulty by giving you another vague hint.
 
When you take the log out of the cache, note that the edge of it is in the cover (this makes it easy to get the log out of the cache). Bring something to sign the log with as there is no pencil in the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Hidden on 7/4/2006 - Happy 230th Birthday America!

A bit harder find than our 2 legged tree, especially in the summer when heavy leaf coverage impedes the sat signal.  

Originally contained: David's computer, happy toaster, horseshoe wire puzzle, construction worker action figure, shark tooth necklace, Sega electronic fishing game (it works), black windup monkey walker, teenage mutant ninja turtle figure (it's really mutant because it's headless), T-rex dino, cactus, AND the "I'll Show You the Way" travel bug which we picked up in Florida.

Lots of trails in this area that can take you in many directions.  A great park to explore with a number of caches to find.  Welcome to our neighborhood.</groundspeak:long_description>

front the of building and a little calf joined them after the
auction-but I'm not changing the name of the cache to 2.5 Herd or
something like that. Enjoy this easy one except for all the muggle
traffic you will see while you try to look. NO Admission fee is
necessary to find this container. Plenty of parking too.

Before you can claim your Smiley, you must first, perform the ‘Mission’ as described in the cache; then post your find and E-mail me indicating what mission you have accomplished. You can make it as simple or as difficult as you want -  most likely you will do it not at the cache site (could be at home or elsewhere). Do I have your curiousity going? Logs will be deleted, if you don't send me your mission, or you mention them in your log. Please do not describe your mission directly or in such a way that may spoil it for others. I've experienced a cache like this and enjoyed it - hopefully you will also.

If you have any extra time, stop in at the Interpretive Center/rest area and see the Sinclair Lewis museum (free admission). This was his hometown. It's very interesting.

&lt;b&gt;Cache Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This cache was originally hidden as part of the One Degree of
Separation Geocaching Project, which sought to unite the entire
geocaching continuum together at one point using the "Small World
Theory". It was Minnesota's very first ODS cache, and was brought
back here from Milwaukee by pfalstad and I in 2006. But alas, all
good things must come to an end, and I've converted it to a regular
cache so that it's legacy may live on...if you're interested, you
can still read about the project &lt;a title="Visit the project!"
   href="http://www.geoonedegree.proboards51.com/" target=
   "_new"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Location, Parking, and Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This cache is located in a Hopkins city park, just off of Nine Mile
Cove. Free and legal parking is available at a small lot, located
at N 44° 54.618 W 093° 24.217 - it's a straight shot from the
adjacent trailhead there directly to the cache location. Along the
way, you will be serenaded by the pleasant sounds of nature, along
with a myriad of never-ending high-speed traffic noise from Highway
169.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The cache has been upgraded from the old 35mm film cannister to a
nice large Lock 'n Lock box. During the spring and summer, if you
walk just past the cache and loop back along the stream, you'll
find a lil' path right to the cache location...it's easier than
bushwhacking straight in from the trail. The location is not super
winter friendly, but the cache is big enough and the search area is
small enough that this cache should be accessible all year 'round.
Thanks to everyone who participated in the ODS project, and as
always - have fun, and happy hunting! &lt;br&gt;

For the kids there are a series of parks along the two and a half mile trail around what seems like a swamp. What is hard to find near the trail is a lake. I think it is just Shingle Creek stretching out and taking a rest before it continues it's way to the Mississippi in Camden.
If you park at East Palmer Park, watch your step.  The geese have beeen busy.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is a camouflaged Lock N' Lock container. It is located
in Civic Center Park in Burnsville.&lt;br&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br&gt;
Long Description: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Civic Center Park is a 60 acre park located next to City Hall on
Civic Center Parkway, east of Nicollet Avenue between 130th and
134th Streets. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The features of this park include a Hockey rink, Pleasure rink,
In-Line skating rink, Warming house, Walking trails, and Natural
area. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are also Special Use Areas; a Small outdoor amphitheater -
the location of Wednesday in the Park performances, the
Bicentennial Garden, and the Ice Center. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The cache has been moved to a new location after the original
hiding spot was destroyed and the cache disappeared. Parking is
permitted along 130th St and will get you fairly close to the
cache. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The original contents include:&lt;br&gt;
Log&lt;br&gt;
Pencil&lt;br&gt;
Bubbles&lt;br&gt;
Folding Fan&lt;br&gt;
Zippitz Lanyard&lt;br&gt;
Rotary 4-Way Test Coin (not trackable)&lt;br&gt;
Pooh Bear Eraser&lt;br&gt;
Lizard&lt;br&gt;
5 in 1 Emergency Whistle &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since this is a new location, with a new logbook, there will be new
FTF. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is our fourth cache hide, we hope your enjoy it! &lt;br&gt;

Seek a regular sized cache located fairly close to the walking trail.  Stealth may be necessary and diligence will certainly be required!

look&lt;br /&gt;

After solving the sudoku, get the coords using the following
formula,&lt;br /&gt;
using only the ones digit of each sum. (Example: 5 + 7 -&amp;gt; 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">With our foray into geocoin collecting we decided it was time to
open a bank! This geocoin exchange bank is located with convenient
parking and 24 hour access. During some hours stealth may be
required.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The listed coordinates will get you to the teller at the bank who
will then direct you to the safe deposit box where GEOCOINS ONLY
are exchanged. Since this is a GEOCOIN ONLY exchange the Chancellor
strongly suggests that you do leave a coin for each one taken.
However, you won't actually find that engraved on the cornerstone
of the bank. Please be considerate of other depositors
though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For coins that reach their maturity of deposit (around 30 days or
so, perhaps a bit longer over winter), they will be withdrawn and
deposited elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;
Security is our utmost concern and we are proud to note that with
the many coins that have passed through our bank, only 4 have been
taken but not been logged out of it! (almost 300 coins in 4
years!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both stages of this cache are winter friendly although you may have
to step through some snow at stage 2!&lt;br /&gt;

FTF honors go to TeamDogs!&lt;br /&gt;

     beautiful symbols of the USA. Cache is a small aluminum
     container with twist off lid. There is an american flag pin
     for the FTF. Difficulty reflects that stealth is a must to
     preserve the hide. Enjoy the area. Thank you AE0AL for
     clearing the area for a new cache.</groundspeak:short_description>

birds play and bathe. Decided to stash a cache here for either a
quick park and grab or great start to the loop around this nice
lake trail. This is smaller than a film container so you will need
your own crayon. Very easy find though. Not living here long we
have to wonder if people actually boat on this water.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache has been approved by the Three Rivers Park District. It
is just off of the Disk Golf Course, so you might want to watch out
for disk golfers. Unless you take the secret way up, you have to
walk on the course. It is pretty easy to find, but it is in some
thorns. Please hide it like you found it. This cache started out
with 5 travel bugs in it.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My grandpa used to own a motel near Madison, Wisconsin called The
Docter Inn. I decided I had to open a travel bug hotel called The
Docter Inn on Bryant Lake. This is the first hotel of a chain of
Docter Inns that I plan to open. I will open one up when I save up
enough Travel Bugs. You can take anything you want that is in the
cache, but please ONLY leave Travel Bugs and Geocoins. The Docter
Inn on Bryant Lake has beautiful views of Bryant Lake. It is also
quite close to the beach. A boat landing, paddle boats, and canoes
are close by. A playground is near and Disk Golfing is right our
your door. I am sorry, but dogs are not allowed in the area. Easy
walk from the road. The Motel is open from 5am to Sunset on all
days. Enjoy your stay at The Docter Inn on Bryant Lake.</groundspeak:long_description>

Due to recurrent problems with stage I, we converted the cache into a single stage cache. On some days this could be a very crowded place. At other times it can be a ghost town. The cache is NOT on private property nor right on the baseball field. The cache is winter friendly.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to Rick on achieving 5,000+ finds!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Please include
reminiscences of caching adventures with Rick,&lt;br /&gt;
or mention your favorite RR hide in your log
entry.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#347235"&gt;If you live in the western metro area
and have cached for any length of time&lt;br /&gt;
you know who rickrich is. He&amp;rsquo;s an old school cacher and a
simple guy who&lt;br /&gt;
plays by the rules. Rick has been caching mostly around the twin
cities&lt;br /&gt;
metro area since 2002. Rick is one of the original FTF hounds and
has&lt;br /&gt;
over 700 FTF&amp;rsquo;s to his name. He&amp;rsquo;s still the guy to beat
in the west&lt;br /&gt;
metro and his ability to brute force a find is legendary. Those of
us who know Rick&lt;br /&gt;
probably first ran into him on an FTF run often wearing his
signature yellow jacket&lt;br /&gt;
and red hat. Most people know who rickrich is because of his over
300 hides&lt;br /&gt;
(also a recent milestone). Richrich has his share of puzzles&lt;br /&gt;
and difficult hides, but he takes pride in placing caches that are
findable.&lt;br /&gt;
Because his caches are plentiful and accessible most newbies in
the&lt;br /&gt;
west metro learn how to hide caches by the example he sets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for all the great hides Rick and way to go on getting to
5,000 finds and beyond!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#347235"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#151B8D"&gt;Seek regular
sized cache. Beware of barbed wire in the area. Somehow I did not
notice it when I placed the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FTF honors go to rickrich and the WNC!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache has been approved by the Eden Prairie Parks
Dept.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
p.s. Thanks to Minnstars for his help in setting up the cache page
before I knew how to add all the bells and whistles!&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This Cache is off hwy 10 near the Bailey Station Cemetery. Park in front of the cemetery.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is the site of Bailey Station, a small town that was founded in the early 1850's. All that is left is the cemetery and a house north of the highway. Bailey Station is still found on many Minnesota Highway maps.
Orlando Bailey came to Big Lake township from New York in 1852 and opened a hotel and a stage coach stop on what is now Hwy 10.
A small community soon formed, complete with a railroad station. The Hwy interchange caused the removal of the old school house and a 1930's gas station that was moved to the Sherburne History Center (See Sherburne History TB Hotel).

System. &lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The Humboldt Greenway is a neighborhood revitalization program
on Lind-Bohanon's western border. More than 200 houses and local
businesses were razed and replaced with new single family homes,
multifamily townhomes, Shingle Creek Commons apartments for seniors
and Kingsley Commons apartments for persons with MS. Originally the
project was to remove the entire neighborhood including putting a
lake where a brand new school is.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This hide incorporates two of the characteristic of geocaching  that I enjoy most.  Fun with the family and tracking travel bugs.  Thus, the container is divided into two compartments, a toy side and a travel bug hotel side.  The toy side is loaded with fun stuff for the kids.  I know from my own experience that kids like to go along with dad geocaching if he goes to "one of the big ones with toys".  This is a cache for them so please keep the toy side full. Feel free to let each kid grab something but be sure to replace with an equal number of goodies.   

For the travel bug mover this is a quick easy drop/grab on your way by.  

One more thing, keep an eye out for gophers and balls!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Elk River has long been a leader in energy. Across the highway you see the site of the first rural nuclear power plant in the United States. It went online in 1960 . Meant only as a demonstration site it was dismantled after several successful years of operation.
In the late 1980's, GRE's power plant was converted to burn refuse derived fuel. This innovative source of energy was one factor that helped Elk River receive the designation of "Energy City" by the Minnesota Environmental Initiative in October of 1997. As Energy City, Minnesota's energy industries will be demonstrating cutting edge renewable and energy efficient technologies in Elk River.

P.S A note from Kliener with some more interesting stuff:
 "A couple of tidbits. That concrete thingy sticking out into the river, just downstream from GZ. That was the exchanger for the cooling water for all of these types of power generation at this plant. Before the Monti and the Becker plants were built this was maybe the furthest upstream that there was such a great amount of river water used to cool. So, that meant that in winter from this spot upstream the river would actually freeze over all of the way across. There were a lot of folks that used to fish this spot because it was the only open water in winter. The other thought I had was I remember when the plant used to belch out huge amounts of soot and smoke. There, across the highway from this spot was a pretty popular sliding hill in the winter. The folks at the plant were ok with everyone using it until someone got the idea of going up and down the hill with footprints and stomping out, in large letters, in the blackened snow. The words STOP POLLUTION. Those words stood right out in the clean white snow under the crust of blackened snow on the hill. And, that was the end of the friendly sliding hill.

 &lt;br&gt;
 The Victory neighborhood is home to North Minneapolis’ only lake –
Ryan Lake. It borders the cities of Robbinsdale, Brooklyn Center
and Minneapolis. Hidden away at 47th and Xerxes Avenue North, the
Ryan Lake shoreline is a beautiful, open public space. 
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Pacific owns a rail line corridor in the Humboldt
Industrial Park that runs along the northern shore of the lake. The
City of Minneapolis owns land on the east side of the lake, which
is maintained by the Minneapolis Park &amp;amp; Recreation Board
(MPRB). The rest of the shoreline along the west and east sides of
the lake is rimmed by private residents. The first phase of the
Ryan Lake shoreline restoration, was completed in September 2004.
Over 60 neighborhood residents came together to plant over 6,000
native plants on an eroding shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources conducted a fish
survey on Ryan Lake in 2003. They reported that Ryan Lake had a
great diversity of fish species and sizes and that it provides an
excellent opportunity for sport fishing in the urban metro area.
Fish species surveyed included above average numbers of northern
pike, black crappie, yellow perch and black bullhead, bluegill
sunfish (the most abundant species), largemouth bass, brown
bullheads, bowfin, common carp, green sunfish and hybrid
sunfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On street parking on Xerxes Avenue, there is no need to venture
onto the railroad property and the cache is a bit larger than a
film canister with a FTF prize inside. Minneapolis Park hours are
6:00 AM to 10:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

Easy find with easy access.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I was looking for a reason to put a cache here and the collector gave me one.  I have never met two of hearts but I have seen their name show up on new logs before mine.  They have a lot of hides in this area.  I do not know how many FTFs they have, so I would not call them first to find HOGs.  This hide is a ways out of my teritory but it is right in theirs.

No need to mess up the landscaping.

You do not have to create a new cache to log this cache.  If you want to propagate the series, then here are the collectors rules:

This series just has a couple of simple rules.
1. If a cache is placed with your name, then it would be nice if you placed a cache with someone else’s name. This way someone else gets the FTF on a cache other then you!

2. If you beat someone else to the FTF on a cache with their name, then it would be nice if both of you would place a cache in someone else’s name.

3. Please keep the title the same for all new caches released. Just change the cachers name when you place the new cache.

4. Please have fun with this. We are all out here to enjoy the outdoors and meet new people. But a little good natured ribbing and maybe a small story about this person is always enjoyed

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="6"&gt;Floating
Copper&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I used to work on the docks at the US Corp of Engineers station on
Minnesota Point and recall walking past this monument that was
sitting in some obscure corner of the station. I was fascinated by
the immense size of it and always wondered why it was out of public
view. Well now it has a new home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you see before you is a rare example of a piece of float
copper dredged from the Keweenaw Waterway in Michigan in 1937 by
the dredge New Jersey. The dredge was under contract with the US
Army Corp of Engineers office in Duluth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can copper float?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No, not in the traditional sense of the term. Float is a geological
term used to describe any material that has been carried by erosion
away from its &lt;img alt="" hspace="3" src=
"http://ritteja.googlepages.com/Native_Copper_Macro_Digon3.jpg"
align="left" vspace="3" border="0"&gt;spot of formation, as in this
example by glaciation.&amp;nbsp; This process is very important to
prospectors who track “float” patterns to its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native copper is very abundant in the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan in basaltic lava and interlayered sediments formed
approximately a billion years ago. Freed from the rock by
weathering, this copper can survive long transport by glaciers and
rivers because of its tenacity and relatively low chemical
reactivity. Float copper is found all states that have received
glacial drift from the Lake Superior region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1895, a Wisconsin geologist, Roland Salisbury, made a
detailed study of float copper in Wisconsin. He states "specimens
of 40 to 50 lbs, weight are not uncommon".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the more notable drift copper finds from
Wisconsin, as reported by Salisbury and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASHLAND COUNTY: Salisbury (1885) reports the find of a 100 lb
copper boulder from Outer Island.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAYFIELD COUNTY: The largest nugget of float copper reported
from the Wisconsin is a boulder weighing 1,700 lbs. found in the
bed of the Sioux River about 6 miles south of Lake Superior
(Salisbury, 1885).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DANE COUNTY: A 30 lb. nugget of drift copper was found in a 20
foot deep well in Madison (Salisbury, 1885).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DODGE COUNTY: A nugget of float copper weighing 487 lbs. was
found near Hustiford (Irving, 1882).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROCK COUNTY: A 114 lb. nugget of drift copper was found at
Newark (Salisbury, 1885).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SHAWANO COUNTY: A 970 lb. mass of drift copper was found in a
gravel pit 2 miles south of Pella (Wisconsin Geological Survey
files).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TO LOG THIS CACHE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1) What month was this float copper discovered?&lt;br&gt;
2) Based on the weight given and current commodity price of copper
calculate the current market value of the piece of float
copper.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#DDE6F2"&gt;Two hunters from Michigan--(true story) This
is from a radio program, a true report of an incident in Michigan: 
&lt;p&gt;A guy buys a brand new Lincoln Navigator for $42,500 and has
$560 monthly payments. He and a friend go duck hunting in winter,
and of course all the lakes are frozen. These two guys go out on
the lake with the guns, the dog, and of course the new vehicle.
They drive out onto the lake ice and get ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, they want to make some kind of a natural landing area for
the ducks, something for the decoys to float on. In order to make a
hole large enough to look like something a wandering duck would fly
down and land on, it is going to take a little more effort than an
ice hole drill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, out of the back of the new Navigator comes a stick of
dynamite with a short, 40-second fuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these two Rocket Scientists do take into consideration that
they want to place the stick of dynamite on the ice at a location
far from where they are standing (and the new Navigator), because
they don't want to take the risk of slipping on the ice when they
run from the burning fuse and possibly go up in smoke with the
resulting blast. So, they light the 40-second fuse and throw the
dynamite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, remember a couple of paragraphs back when I mentioned the
vehicle, the guns and the dog? OK. Let's talk about the dog: A
highly trained Black Lab used for &lt;i&gt;RETRIEVING&lt;/i&gt;. Especially
things thrown by the owner. You guessed it, the dog takes off at a
high rate of doggy speed on the ice and captures the stick of
dynamite with the burning 40-second fuse about the time it hits the
ice. The two men yell, scream, wave their arms and wonder what to
do now. The dog, cheered on, keeps coming. One of the guys grabs
the shotgun and shoots the dog. The shotgun is loaded with # 8
buckshot, hardly big enough to stop a Black Lab. The dog stops for
a moment, slightly confused, but continues on. Another shot and
this time the dog, still standing, becomes really confused, and of
course terrified, thinking these two geniuses have gone insane. The
dog takes off to find cover, under the brand new Navigator.
&lt;b&gt;---BOOM!----&lt;/b&gt; Dog and Navigator are blown to bits and sink to
the bottom of the lake in a very large hole, leaving the two idiots

&lt;p&gt;The insurance company says that sinking a vehicle in a lake by
illegal use of explosives is not covered. He still had yet to make
the first of those $560 a month payments! And you thought your day

&lt;p&gt;Cough CPR A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mail
sends it to 10 people, you can bet that we'll save at least one
life. Read this... It could save your life!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say it's 6.15 pm and you're driving home (alone of
course), after an unusually hard day on the job. You're really
tired, upset and frustrated. Suddenly you start experiencing severe
pain in your chest that starts to radiate out into your arm and up
into your jaw. You are only about five miles from the hospital
nearest your home. Unfortunately you don't know if you'll be able
to make it that far. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy that
taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack,
without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who
begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing
consciousness. However, these victims can help themselves by
coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be
taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged,
as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. A breath and a
cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let-up until
help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally
again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing
movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The
squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm.
In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. Tell as
many other people as possible about this. It could save their
lives!!&lt;br /&gt;

the end, their words cost them $10,000 in stereo

&lt;h4&gt;The map doesn’t show it but the cache is on City of Brooklyn
Center property. Pedestrian access is via the minimum maintenance
section of 51st Ave N. You may want to park on Twin Lake Blvd East.
The majority of the wooded property is private but the cache is on
public land.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Special logging requirements are optional:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Consider having your log entry can contain only the
following.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
For a find: “I wanna be a pony in Ponyville!”
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
For a DNF: “I wanna be a pony in Ponyville but lost my way.”
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the winter of 2008 there was an activity at the Hennepin
County Brookdale Library where you could write your dream on a
star, which would then be added to all the other submitted dreams
on display in the rotunda. One dream written in a grownup’s hand
stated “I want to be a pony in Ponyville”. Once while I was reading
the dreams the Children’s Librarian came over to look at them at
the same time. I commented on the Ponyville dream, was it a child’s
wish or an adults and what does it mean in either case? I thought
about this dream for days as there it was in the rotunda everytime
I visited. Then I finally did an Internet search on Ponyville and
low and behold it’s simply where My Little Pony lives! Of course
the child wants to live with My Little Pony. There was no deeper
meaning and the sneaky Children’s Librarian left me to ponder “I
want to be a pony in Ponyville.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE by Debbie Boone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 So many nights I sit by my window&lt;br /&gt;
Waiting for someone to sing me his song&lt;br /&gt;
So many dreams I kept deep inside me&lt;br /&gt;
Alone in the dark but now&lt;br /&gt;
You've come along&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You light up my life&lt;br /&gt;
You give me hope&lt;br /&gt;
To carry on&lt;br /&gt;
You light up my days&lt;br /&gt;
and fill my nights with song&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water&lt;br /&gt;
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, a chance to say hey,&lt;br /&gt;
I love You&lt;br /&gt;
Never again to be all alone&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You light up my life&lt;br /&gt;
You give me hope&lt;br /&gt;
To carry on&lt;br /&gt;
You light up my days&lt;br /&gt;
and fill my nights with song&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You light up my life&lt;br /&gt;
You give me hope&lt;br /&gt;
To carry on&lt;br /&gt;
You light up my days&lt;br /&gt;
and fill my nights with song&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It can't be wrong&lt;br /&gt;
When it feels so right&lt;br /&gt;
'Cause You&lt;br /&gt;
You light up my life

&lt;b&gt;Cache Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a quick and easy Kids and Family Friendly cache, just off a
hidden lil' walking trail in Plymouth. The path follows the swampy
shores of Turtle Lake, although in the summer you'll need
binoculars to actually see the water. It's a nice area all year
'round, and quite popular with the locals - watch out for muggles,
and don't forget your bug spray!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location, Parking, and Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can access the trail from the South at Old Rockford Road, or
from the North at Quantico Lane. Trail access is also available
from the church parking lot at Vicksburg Lane, but you park there
at your own risk. No matter how you get to it, it's a short walk on
a level paved trail, with a mild bushwhack at the very end. There
was heavy tree cover today while I was grabbing coords, but I
suspect your geo-sense will guide you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a nice big Lock 'n Lock container, hidden in
the usual sort of place, although it's only accessible from one
side. It starts out with assorted camping supplies, a handful of
trinkets hand-selected from the 'Noles kidlet's personal
collection, a couple of trackables, and a $10 dog-bowling themed
(honest!) Target gift card for the first finder. Enjoy your stroll,
and as always - thanks, have fun, and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As I pulled into this park to find QIFT's new multi-cache the other
day, I realized that I'd passed a milestone of sorts: the odometer
read 100,001 miles on my '06 hybrid cachemobile. I thought it'd be
fun to hide a cache here to celebrate, so here it is!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location, Parking, and Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is hidden on the shores of South Twin Lake, at Lions
Park in Robbinsdale. Ample free and legal parking is provided at a
small lot on the south side of the park. You can turn directly onto
the access road if you're Northbound on 81, otherwise you can turn
at Lake Drive Ave N and again at Lakeland Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a "mini-acro", it's not on the ground but you can
still walk directly up to the hiding spot. There are lots of
handholds, but please use your best judgement if it's icy or wet,
and I'd avoid it altogether if it's dark. You're looking for a
small black rectangular container from Ax-Man, a replacement
container stashed by Quilting is fun too...as always - thanks, have
fun, and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;

A quick and easy Kids, Family, and travel bug friendly cache at
Clifton E. French Regional Park in Plymouth!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cache Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 'Noles kidlets wanted to hide a large cache, so during a beach
day this past weekend, we took the time to wander the trails
looking for big hiding spots. This is one of my family's favorite
parks, and during the summer, if we're not lounging at the beach
you can pr'bly find us exploring the spectacular play area and
cargo-net climbing structure. Winter activities include a lighted
sledding hill for year-round fun!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location, Parking, and Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
French Park is open 5am-sunset all year long; please be mindful of
park hours. You will find the cache conveniently located directly
adjacent to the Moraine picnic area, just around the corner from
the parking area on a nice paved trail. From the main entrance,
look for the road to the Skyview/Moraine reservation areas on your
right, as you wind your way through the park.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You're looking for a rather large 1-gallon thermos-type container,
hidden in the usual sort of place. It starts out stuffed to the
brim with five trackables looking to travel, assorted camping
supplies, the usual $10 Target gift card, one of my 'reserved'
pathtags, and assorted toys and trinkets hand-selected by the
'Noles kidlets from their own personal collection. As always -
thanks, have fun, and happy hunting!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;hr&gt;

This cache is hiding near a gift shop (with permission, of course), so you can park on the street.  There is a playground nearby, as well as a public beach to unwind at after some geocaching!  

This is a good cache for a family, a quick find, and is close to a public restroom.

You are looking for a green ammo box, with a logbook, pen and pencil, and plenty of room for trading items.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Story submitted by: David Astroberden &lt;br&gt;
Age: Unknown &lt;br&gt;
Occupation: Air Force Pilot &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The specific encounter I am describing is not my first but I would
not like to remember my previous abductions but to describe one
specific abduction that occured when I was 17. After I completed an
ROTC pilot training course, I was on my way home. About that time I
noticed a glowing object.The time was aproximately 8:30. As this
wasn't my first encounter, I assumed it was a UFO. As I was staring
at it from my car, I suddenly got out to view it. I was viewing the
object for quite some time until I saw it drop down and land
somewhere in the woods. I was then scared to further investigate,
so I ran back to my car and for some reason it would not start. I
was about to walk down the road when I saw 4-5 figures emerge out
of the woods. I was shocked and frightened. I did nothing but stare
at the figures as they came closer until they came in my car and
took me in their ship. Inside it was pitch black and there was a
screen on one wall and a chair right in front of it. They placed me
in the chair and put some sort of drill in my nose and then checked
my eyes with some sort of a metalic device that had a blue light.
After they were done examining me they told me that I would not be
harmed and I can return to my car. Before they took me away I asked
"who or what are you?" The same voice responded telepathically, "We
are from the future. We travel back in time to get organs from
humans before we evolve because our planet is dying." After that I
was taken to my car and I asked, "What happened at Roswell?"
Another voice told me telepathically that the government did
recover a spaceship and they are not working with us but trying to
manipulate us into helping them. Since then, I haven't been able to
sleep well and I have paranioa and was placed in a mental hospital
on three different occasions. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Additional Comment: &lt;br&gt;
(We would like to point out that this may be a prime example of a
completely fabricated story....but unfortunately, as with most of
these submitted stories, we have no way of knowing for sure.....you
will have to decide what to believe.)&lt;br&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Peril to he who try to steel my golden treasure. I have lain here
all these many years, the keeper of the secret, the one to fear. I
have arisen. I know the log.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;span id="LongDescription"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;span id="LongDescription"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/user/790e76f8-1a0e-4e82-9320-8f03ecf9fa20.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the early 1700’s a single pirate ship ventured north, up the
Mississippi River, to what is now known as Minneapolis/St. Paul.
After arriving, Captain Blackheart ordered his men to offload all
the treasure from his holds, and burry it in the area the native
Indians called “Minnetonka”. 
&lt;p&gt;Fearing his treasure would be found, Captain Blackheart selected
a single man to stay behind and guard the treasure he held so dear.
Blackheart chose a man so feared, that a single utterance of his
name caused the ground to shake. For this reason, he wrote the name
in a log book so as not to speak it. The log was passed among the
crew until it reached the man whose name it contained. In an
instance, he ripped his name from the book and proclaimed the
treasure his, and his alone. Blackheart ordered the man to walk the
plank for trying to steal the treasure. A long and fierce battle
ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, only one man stood. As the ground shook beneath his
feet, the man spoke. “All who come to find my treasure shall see
the peril of those who came before. Only those who place their name
in the log and vow to protect the secret, shall see another
day.”&lt;/p&gt;
Bring the kids along for this one. Very kid friendly!

&lt;p&gt;Aah, Summer Little League. Once upon a time, it actually
involved baseball ;). Besides the 9-strike rule, the oddest thing I
remember was how pop fly balls seemed the break the laws of
physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated in their honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF Prizes / Original contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AM/FM jogging radio - still works, but missing the strap and
clip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approx $3 in Boxtops for Education / Soup labels for Education
tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior Lake can coozie&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paths in this area are hard packed black dirt, and are subject
to change. I have tried to place the cache near a trail that should
remain open year-round, but depending on rain and vegetation, you
may need to seek alternate routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adjacent school uses this park for recess, use extreme
stealth, or avoid while children are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF Honors go to Dances with Beehives.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for an Ammo Can. Starting off in the Cache are 2 coins and a TB along with a snowboarding DVD (I think its from Burton), MOA Coupon Book (good through the end of 2008), Monkey Keychain and a logbook and Pen.. Good luck

The Pelican River inlet is located along the northeast shoreline while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline adjacent to the cache. The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots. The maximum depth of Prairie Lake is 22 feet; however, 79% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth. 

Prairie Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community. Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Prairie Lake. The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available and DNR stocking efforts. A high-density northern pike population exists.  (MN DNR)

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Come enjoy the scenic views of South and North Twin Lake in Robbinsdale.  There is a parking lot that you can access from Highway 81 (one short block south of Highway 100).  Muggles are very common on these paths so your best stealth will be needed as you approach each stage.  The difficulty level is because of the stealth needed for the popular paths.

Stage one is at the posted coordinates.  You are searching for a micro at each of the first two stages.  The final cache (a small) should look familiar to shoestorm as he gave it to me while meralgia and I were with him at the Dr. Stangecache puzzle cache.  There is room for small trade items, coins and travel bugs.

Enjoy the journey - especially beautiful at sunrise (and less muggles too)!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;Allow the cache namesake the opportunity to seek
his/her cache and be FTF.&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Back in May of 2005, DJRHJ found her first cache. It was a virtual,
because she did not yet have a gpsr. Now, a couple of gpsr's and a
few years later, she is very excited to be finding her 1000th
cache! Over the years, she has placed many quality caches in the
Southwest Metro (I hear that Purple People Eater is known to be her
most evil hide). DJRHJ often caches with friends and family,
including TheGilby4, ChillyET, and of course her Saturday partner
in caching crime, Smiling Duo. Help celebrate DJRHJ's 1000th find
by coming and finding this cache after her. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font face="arial" size="4"&gt;Congratulations to you DJRHJ on
1000 cache finds!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Now start working on 2000!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Center. The only signs of a park is the ones that say "no motorized
vehicles". Parking is best along Major Ave. FTF prize was a
non-activated 2007 MnGCA geocoin.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was muggled and had to be replaced. I hid a different
container than the original ammo can and hid it a little
differently and hoping this one will last. The originally hide was
placed during my year as Vice-President of the MnGCA and I am
currently the President of the Organization. I started caching in
Feburary 2007 and it has become quite the hobby. I enjoy the many
different aspects of geocaching. I am frequently at WeekNIGHT
Caching as well as many different events. I was also able to
complete the Minnesota State Parks Geocaching History Challenge
this year and I was also talked into doing the Kitchen Cove and
Lair caches this summer.

A quick and easy Kids and Family Friendly cache, in another hidden
park in Plymouth!</groundspeak:short_description>

&lt;b&gt;Cache Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I get my allergy shots just around the corner from here, each and
every week, rain or shine. During the mandatory 45-minute waiting
period, I've often gazed out the window and contemplated hiding a
cache nearby...most likely trying to get mind off of the pain in my
arms. My first few scouting missions yielded less than desirable
results, but lo and behold, I think I've found a spot that will
hold a cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location, Parking, and Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is hidden in a tucked-away neighborhood park, made
famous by the mammoth ammo-can hide nearby. (Over 300 finds to
date!) You can park in the small lot by that cache, or at the
enclosed parking coordinates for a shorter walk. There's another
trailhead to the North, but there are super-loud barking dogs if
you come in that way, so it's easier on the neighbors if you come
in from the other two entrances. You'll have good cover most of the
year, even from the nearby houses, but I think some stealth might
be required in the dead of winter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're looking for a regular-sized Lock 'n Lock, which starts out
with an assortment of camping goodies, a nifty geocoin, toys and
trinkets hand-selected from the 'Noles kidlets' personal
collection, and a $10 Target gift card for the first finder. If
you're here on a Monday afternoon, be sure to wave at WestHealth as
you drive by...I'm pr'bly there, wishing I was outside. As always -
thanks, have fun, and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the late seventies there was a kiosk right about here.
There really wasn’t any information on it, no map of the trail
system with a “you are here” or anything except for some graffiti.
The graffiti said “Hockey Sticks Not Bombs”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Timewellspent has been geocaching since May, 24, 2007 and reached the one thousand finds milestone December, 2008.  Also in that time he placed 25 caches.  His caches are well known and feared in the SW Metro geocaching community and his caches collectively have been nominated for cache of the month.  While his puzzles can be difficult and vexing, he is always generous with help and hints.  

TWS is focused when it comes to finding caches and can sniff out a difficult cache in mere minutes.  It is no wonder that he so easily reached his one thousand milestone.

When you find this cache, if you are so inclined, please note in the cache log a specific memory you may have of a time you met, emailed, or found a cache of Timewellspent.  Good natured ribbing is not out of the question.  

Good Luck to TWS in his future cache milestones.  We will see you out on the trail!

This is a very easy cache, in a beautiful Three Rivers Park in Eden Prairie.  This cache has been registered and approved by Three Rivers.</groundspeak:long_description>

They were a fine crew each performing their tasks at sea and on land with such ease, that sometimes Knutson stood in awe watching them. A mixture of Norse and Goths had made this journey. Knutson didn’t trust the Goths, although it was true that they were Christians like himself, they had some lofty goals, and after all it was the Goths that overran the Roman Empire. In the back of his mind he wondered if they would ever try to over run his homeland. While it was true they were friendly towards each other, ambition and greed does funny things to a man. 
The hunting party that had left before dawn was now returning. Several Geese, Ducks and a large Whitetail Buck were among their quarry. The crew would eat heartily during the day’s voyage. With the lack of wind, much energy would be spent manning the oars of the Knorr and Long Boats through the waters, the fresh game would be very welcome.
 It was decided that Bjorkland would take the lead Long Boat, and find a camp for the next night. Although normally this would be considered a dangerous tactic, they had not encountered any hostile Natives for some time. They knew that word had gotten around about their fierceness in battle, and anticipated no problems. Besides,the best warriors and Bezerkers, would be sent on the lead boat to make up for the lack of men.       Camp was broke and the voyage continued.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">As they broke camp in preparation for another day’s voyage, Bjorkland and Knutson were discussing the topography. Just two days voyage ago they were in the flattest land they had ever seen. Now they were in the midst of many hills, not nearly as tall as the Fjords of home, but it still reminded them of their homeland. Knutson’s thoughts drifted to his beloved Mildred. It had been quite a while since they last shared a bed. He hoped that all was well with her, and the rest of his family left back in Newfoundland. The winds had picked up, so the men would get a rest from the oars, but with the hilly terrain the wind would not be as strong as they desired, and some rowing would still be necessary. It was mid fall and they marveled at the colors held in the trees and brush that covered the hillsides. They had seen colors before of course, but never in such abundance, and with such vibrancy. As the fall air nipped at them they new that it would not be long before the waters would freeze, and they would have to find a suitable winter camp. But for now, they would sail as long as nature would let them.</groundspeak:long_description>

A nice paved trail circles the park and winds quietly through some of the neighborhoods. If you visit during the warmer months watch where you step.

There are only a handful of parking spots on the east side of the park but this cache should be a quick one is kid-friendly, even in winter.

You are looking for a small, camo-covered jar with log book &amp; pencils, the usual swag and a geocoin. There's room for small trackables amd there's  a John Adams gold dollar for the FTF.

A nice paved trail circles the park and then winds quietly through some of the neighborhoods. If you visit during the warmer months watch where you step....or slip.

There are only a handful of parking spots on the east side of the park but the walk to this cache will let you tour the west side too. Wild raspberry bushes abound. Beware of muggles from all angles. This cache is kid-friendly, even in winter but do watch for nettles. During the thaw and rainy times this approach could have very wet footing.

Summer plant growth will slow your approach to the cache but a nearby diminutive muggle play area is your biggest concern. Please re-cover cache when you're done.

The cache container is on the small side of regular and contains the usual fare (toys), unusual fare (IBM Prestige typewriter head), a very cool geocoin, and a Susan B Anthony dollar coin for the FTF.

CONGRATULATIONS divercth on being FTF here! Thanks.

Dedicated to Baby Boomers who still know how to twist, this cache is hidden in your honor.

We’ve filled it with a prize for FTF and STF (second to find because we’ve been there!) along with an assortment of other goodies. Please remember to trade even, trade up!

Hidden just off a very well traveled path, please use stealth, especially during warmer days and when the fishing is good. Please re-hide the cache as found or better to preserve anonymity from the many muggles on the path and lake shore.


Congratulations, Sparkyfry, on your FTF!!  and congratulations to Quilting is Fun Too for STF!! Thanks for looking for our cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

Dedicated to Baby Boomers, who have no idea what these lyrics meant, this cache is hidden in your honor.

The cache is too small for trade items but we did manage to leave a small prize for the FTF.

The cache is hidden just off a heavily traveled pathway. There is much traffic at the near-by ballfields and boat launch. Please use stealth--be sure to look for muggles in all directions--and re-hide the cache as found or better to preserve its anonymity.


Congratulations to mnfishnutz and his Geoson on  FTF!! (and the 300th find)</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache you seek is on the small side of regular and holds what it should hold including a geocoin. There is a prize for the FTF. 

Muggles love to invade this area during the warmer month(s). Use stealth or a cloaking device if you have it.

Your parking options will vary greatly depending upon the time of year you seek this cache. So you may have up to a mile of walking round-trip. The longer walk was taken into account for the terrain rating. 

This cache is registered with the Three Rivers Park District. Please obey all park rules, enjoy your visit and practice CITO &amp; DIPO.

NOTE: Don't forget your camera!

Dedicated to Baby Boomers, who remember when Highway 100 was at the limit and lined with lilacs, this cache is hidden in your honor.

Built in the 1930s as a New Deal works project, Highway 100 was originally conceived as a perimeter road for Minneapolis, thus the even number, 100. Proponents wanted to see a by-pass for the city that would end congestion on the city’s streets, and set out to beautify the “Beltway” by planting hundreds of lilac bushes along its right of way to give it a park-like appearance.

Opponents of it argued the highway was too far from residential limits and that it required drivers to go way out of their way to be of any use. Merchants were fearful that the new highway would decrease the traffic flow past their businesses by travelers from rural areas. And for 20 years their prediction may have had some truth to it.

However, the Baby Boom of the 1950s increased the demand for housing and led to rapid growth in the suburbs. Today, “out-ringed” by Highway 169 and Interstate 494, Highway 100 remains a main thoroughfare through the first tier of suburbs. Recent construction has turned it into a freeway and the need to widen it caused most of the lilacs to be removed. Drivers can see a few that survived in the backyards of St. Louis Park homes along the freeway.

This cache is hidden in the now forgotten Graeser Park. This park is one of five that were intended as traveler rest areas and welcomed picnickers, featuring stone picnic tables, beehive barbecues, waterfalls, and stone-walled parking lots. These fixtures provided work for local stonemasons, as a part of the WPA project. Remnants of their fine workmanship can still be seen although they are in sad disrepair. Take some time as you stroll in the park to admire their work.

We have filled the cache with a few goodies and a small prize for the FTF. Please remember to trade even, trade up.

Dedicated to Baby Boomers, who knew the score, this cache is hidden in your honor. 

Hidden in Bass Creek Park, Brooklyn Park. The muggle factor may be a problem in summer so please use stealth. This cache will hold small TBs and geocoins along with small trade items. We’ve filled it to start and there is a small prize for FTF.

Congratulations to FreiGuy for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Welcome to Fort Snelling State Park – an Urban Wilderness right in
the middle of the Twin City metropolitan area. Many of the animals
living here have adapted to being the in presence of humans
extremely well.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fort Snelling State Park's Safari cache is a nice multi that tests
you puzzle skills and learn something about the park and it's
critter. &lt;b&gt;You'll want to bring a writing utensil along to assist
you with the cache.&lt;/b&gt; The first stage is near parking and
eventually gets you on to Pike Island where you keep you eyes open
for many different mammals and birds. Deer are abundant and have
little fear of humans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wildlife in the park:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The forest bottoms and marshes are home to an abundance of
wildlife, including white-tailed deer, fox, woodchucks, turkeys,
and coyotes. Visitors might also come across a fox snake which is
almost identical in appearance to a rattle snake, but is not
poisonous. Snapping, soft-shelled and painted turtles can be seen
basking in the sun along the river or in one of the lakes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For hundreds of years before Europeans arrived, generations of
Dakota people lived in villages along the Mississippi and Minnesota
Rivers that meet in Fort Snelling State Park. The river confluence
was believed to be the place of origin and center of the earth by
the bands of Mde-wa-kan-ton-wan Dakota, the "Dwellers by Mystic
Lake." By the late 1600s, Europeans had visited the area. In the
1820s, historic Fort Snelling was built on the bluff above the two
historic rivers to control the exploration, trade, and settlement
on these waterways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The area was established as a state park in 1961. The swimming
beach, added in 1970, remains a popular recreation attraction in
the park. In 1997, a new visitor center opened to the public.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Geology:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During the last Ice Age, retreating glaciers left thick moraine
deposits over the bedrock in the area. As the glaciers melted,
torrential meltwaters carved through the deposits to form the
valleys of what are now the Minnesota, Mississippi and St. Croix
rivers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Landscape:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The park is located in the Mississippi River Sandplains Landscape
Region at the confluence of two great rivers, the Minnesota and the
Mississippi. Most of the park is on the Minnesota River floodplain.
The riverine environment hosts large cottonwood, silver maple, ash,
and willow trees along the braided channels of the Minnesota River.
Numerous picnic sites, a beach, and river and lake fishing invite
visitors to enjoy the recreational opportunities offered by this
historic and beautiful park nestled in the shadow of city freeways
and airport flyways. &lt;br /&gt;

you to fill up on your return trip.

Dedicated to our daughter who sometimes caches with us. 

This one is for all the tiny song birds. Located in Bob Cahlander Park this one is just off the trail near the park and ride. Once you're away from the park and ride you'll be pretty secluded.

We've made this a bird "theme" cache so if possible trade something along that theme. 

We've left a Sacajawea dollar for the first to find. In Hidatsa, Sacaga means 'bird," and wea means "woman." Some North Dakota Hidatsa believe that the name should be spelled "Sakakawea."

Have fun and enjoy the many birds you'll see on this adventure. Look for the pair of wood ducks here.</groundspeak:long_description>

Terrain is a breeze with pavement nearly all the way. Watch yourself during rut in the fall. Lots of amorous bucks around here so maybe you can teach a science lesson?

The trained eye may pick up this cache quickly but we’re going to put our best camo-izers on this one in hopes of making it memorable.

The cache is small but will hold most geocoins and small swag. At time of publishing the cache contains one geocoin.

When we say it, we mean it. This cache IS registered with the Three Rivers Park District. Please obey all park rules, enjoy your visit.

Congratulations mystagogic! I half expect someone to throw on the "hazards" and make this a png though I hope nobody does.</groundspeak:long_description>

Was looking in all the wrong beacons before finally heading to the right location. Nice cache. It's amazing to see these 3 and 4 year old caches and think about the number of times you might have walked or drove right past it before you started playing the game.

be a series of 12 caches on the Gandy Dancer trail and whomever
completes the whole series first will recieve a special prize after
we have verified it. CONGRATS to THE WISCONSIN GOOFTROOP! They were
the 1st to complete the series. They only needed 1 hint! ALL THE
GANDY DANCER CACHES HAVE NEARBY PARKING SO THAT YOU CAN WALK TO THE
CACHE!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on the Gandy Dancer Trail that starts in
St.Croix Falls. There is a series of 12 caches that need to be
completed to win the challenge. The first cachers to finish this
series and have it verified by us will win a special prize. The
best way to access this cache is from the trail. It can be accessed
another way but the terrain difficulty would be much higher. I
would not let young kids go to the final cache location. Hope you
enjoy the trail and this series of caches. And as always -- KEEP ON
CACHING AND HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!! The Geocache Notification Form has
been submitted to Deb Peterson of the Polk County Parks Department.
Geocaches placed on Wisconsin Department of Natural Resource
managed lands require permission by means of a notification form.
Please print out a paper copy of the notification form, fill in all

haul freight through town but there is a tourist train and museum.
Read about the history of this important industry to our area.
Stealth will be required during the busy summer season. This micro
contains a logbook and pencil and may not be winter friendly. The
volunteers at the museum seem to know about the cache, but are not
directly involved in GeoCaching. It would be best to hunt for it
before or after museum hours. Museum is open from Memorial day
through Labor day. Container was replaced on June 9th,

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">An easy cache at an historic home in Eden Prairie.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Originally a stopover point for weary train passengers, the Smith Douglas More house has been a community gathering place since it was built in 1877.  Located near the Minneapolis–St. Louis Railroad Eden Prairie Station, this home and its residents were central to Eden Prairie’s post-settlement period growth.

The Smiths were among the first settlers to Eden Prairie, brought here from the east by the burgeoning railroad system moving west. Like many of the settlers who came to the area, farmland was the primary draw.

Sheldon Smith was born in 1831 and built this house with his wife, Mary, in 1877. The house was a welcome overnight stop for arriving train passengers who stayed at the home before continuing their travels by train or overland by wagon. The Smith’s also boarded several of the area’s teachers and ran a working farm on the property. Sheldon and Mary raised their family— three daughters—in Eden Prairie. Ettie, the youngest daughter, died of tuberculosis when she was only 16 years old in 1881. The Smith’s first daughter, Netta, died in 1861 at age three. As depot agent at the Minneapolis–St. Louis Railroad Eden Prairie Station, it was important to Sheldon to encourage the area’s growth and development. Over his lifetime, a creamery, grain elevator, livestock loading pen, pickle factory, and Miller’s general store all sprung up around his home.

More recently this house was acquired by the City of Eden Prairie and is open to the public, leased as a coffee house.
 
This cache was placed with thanks to and the permission of Ann the operator of this establishment.

No need to look in the brush pile.  It's not there.

A $2 bill awaits the FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hours are the same as all Minneapolis Parks 6:00 AM to 10:00
PM.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 16, 2008 by foundinthewild I got to the cache site and
had a hunch that worked out. Nice spot. Unfortunately, I lost my
spacepen at or near this spot, my second or third that I lost while
caching. I even put rubber bands on it so it wouldn't slip out of
my pocket... or I suppose into my pocket very well either. Enough
whining, this was a fun cache. TNLNSL. TFTC.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry and Elaine go to Florida to visit Jerry's parents for the
weekend and go scuba diving. Morty Seinfeld, Jerry's father, is
also being honored at a ceremony the next night. Jack Klompus comes
over to write Morty a check for a previous night's dinner and Jerry
notices Jack's pen. When Jerry asks Jack about it, Jack tells him
that it can write upside down and that astronauts use it in space.
Jack offers an interested Jerry the pen. Jerry refuses his offer
several times, but Jack persists and Jerry finally gives in. Helen
Seinfeld, Jerry's mother, asks why he took the pen and says he
should give it back because Doris Klompus will tell everyone in the
condo that Jerry made Jack give it to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At her own insistence, Elaine sleeps on a sofa bed with a bar
that sticks up through the mattress and hurts her back. She is
extremely uncomfortable and it is not helped by the fact that the
air conditioning is turned off. Jerry tries to console her by
saying they only have two more days left before they go back to New
York. The next morning, Elaine's back is so hurt that she cannot go
scuba diving with Jerry. Morty suggests she take muscle relaxants.
Rumors begin to spread around the community that Jerry wanted Jack
to give him the pen. Jerry goes scuba diving without Elaine. When
he returns, he has black eyes because the capillaries around his
eyes burst when he went underwater and pressure was too tight on
his mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack comes over again and Jerry returns the pen. Morty yells at
Jack for "taking Jerry's pen". Elaine decides she wants to take the
muscle relaxants, but takes a slight overdose and acts goofily at
the ceremony. Jerry has to wear sunglasses because of his black
eyes. Jack is the Master of Ceremonies and turns the dinner into a
"Roast", making cracks about Morty at the podium. Morty starts
arguing with Jack again about taking back the pen and they start
fighting. The next day, a chiropractor looks at Elaine's back and
tells her she should not go anywhere for at least five days,
extending both her and Jerry's stay even longer.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I had some time to kill so I decided to hide a cache. I was walking
along the path and thought this would be a good place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is wheelchair accessable if you're already on the path.
But getting to the path could be a challenge. So I made this a 1.5
terrain and didn't use the wheelchair icon. However, it is
possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is NOT located on Nobel Ave. Don't waste your time
looking there - and don't put yourself in danger by playing chicken
with the cars! (I already did that to get the coordinates)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The general location of the cache is obvious - just look at the
cache name - but finding it may not be so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Muggles are always present in all seasons - less of them in the
winter, though. Spring time is crazy with muggels as they're so
happy to be out in the warm sun again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GPS coords are only so-so. I tried my best but you'll understand
when you get there. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please make sure the cache container is secure in its hiding spot.
It could easily get lost.&lt;br /&gt;

tradition of the placement of a silver ammo can when a geocacher
reaches the milestone of 1000 finds. This silver ammo can is for
Ice Rocket, who has now found 1000 plus caches.&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" color="blue" size="3"&gt;Ice Rocket
started out caching under the name of tlindmn and is the person

&lt;font face="comic sans ms" color="blue" size="3"&gt;This continues the
tradition of the placement of a silver ammo can when a geocacher
reaches the milestone of 1000 finds. This silver ammo can is for
minnstars, who has now found 1000 plus caches.&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" color="blue" size="3"&gt;Please join me
in offering John a hearty congratulations for reaching the 1000
finds milestone, and doing it so quickly!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" color="blue" size="3"&gt;Not only is
minnstars quite the seeker, he also has many quality hides. If you
like, when you log this find include in your post one of your
favorite finds of any hide by minnstars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Suburbs&lt;/b&gt;, an alternative rock and roll/funk/new wave
band that (true to their name) came out of the western suburbs of
Minneapolis, Minnesota, recorded several major-label albums in the
1980s. Brought together in 1977 via introductions by Chris Osgood
of the Suicide Commandos, the Suburbs maintained the same lineup
throughout their existence. The Suburbs were composed of vocalist
and guitarist Blaine John "Beej" Chaney, guitarist Bruce C. Allen,
keyboardist Chan Poling, bassist Michael Halliday, and drummer Hugo
Klaers. They first started performing in late 1977 and released The
Suburbs on the Twin/Tone label (the label's first release) in early
1978. The record was a nine-song 7-inch red vinyl EP. The band also
saw two songs, "Urban Guerrillas" and "Ailerons O.K.", included on
the compilation Big Hits of Mid-America, Volume Three. Allen did
the art direction for the compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://s518.photobucket.com/albums/u347/cachelife/The%20Suburbs/?action=view&amp;amp;current=litl.jpg"
   target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i518.photobucket.com/albums/u347/cachelife/The%20Suburbs/litl.jpg"
     border="0" alt="Photobucket" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the rest of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s,
the Suburbs grew into a headline act, frequently playing at
Minneapolis's most influential music clubs including Jay's Longhorn
Bar and most notably First Avenue. During this time, their new wave
dance sound, eclectic lyrics, and stage presence gained a following
that broke out of the Midwest and reached both coasts. In 1980
Twin/Tone released their first full length LP, In Combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://s518.photobucket.com/albums/u347/cachelife/The%20Suburbs/?action=view&amp;amp;current=3241_587939043739_45800320_35056376.jpg"
   target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i518.photobucket.com/albums/u347/cachelife/The%20Suburbs/3241_587939043739_45800320_35056376.jpg"
     border="0" alt="Photobucket" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single "World War III" (and its B-side, "Change Agent")
showed development of the band's songwriting abilities and improved
sound. A year later they released the double album Credit In Heaven
which added elements of jazz, funk, and disco to the mix. The
single "Music for Boys" was taken from the record and became a
radio hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://s518.photobucket.com/albums/u347/cachelife/The%20Suburbs/?action=view&amp;amp;current=suburbs2.jpg"
   target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i518.photobucket.com/albums/u347/cachelife/The%20Suburbs/suburbs2.jpg"
     border="0" alt="Photobucket" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1982 the band released a 12-inch single "Waiting," which
frequently found its way onto dance club playlists. An EP Dream Hog
followed on Twin/Tone, featuring three new songs and a remix of
"Waiting" on the B-side, all produced by Steven Greenberg of
Funkytown and Lipps Inc fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg then brought the Suburbs to the attention of Mercury
Records, which added them to their roster in 1983. Mercury started
by re-issuing Dream Hog. By this time, the band's live performances
were muscular and funky, attracting rabid fans and keeping the band
busy as an opening act for the likes of Iggy Pop and The B-52's, as
well as headliners in their own right. In 1983 Mercury released
Love is the Law, a harder-rocking album that included a horn
section and some of their most off-beat lyrics, also produced by
Steven Greenberg. In 1986 the Suburbs signed with A&amp;amp;M Records
and released The Suburbs produced by Prince's Revolution drummer
Bobby Z (Robert Brent). Frustrated by a lack of radio play and
abandoned by the major labels, the band broke up in 1987. In 1992
Twin/Tone released Ladies and Gentlemen, The Suburbs Have Left the
Building, a best-of compilation, and in 1994 a live record Viva!
Suburbs!. The Suburbs reunited during this period and played
numerous shows in the Twin Cities, and have played on and off since
that time including opening once more for the B-52's in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer of 2002 saw the much-anticipated re-issues of the albums
In Combo, Credit In Heaven and Love Is The Law on CD for the first
time (issued on the band's own Beejtar Records - distributed by
Universal). In late 2003 the band issued Chemistry Set: The Songs
Of The Suburbs 1977 - 1987 (a best of CD with a few bonus tracks
and a DVD of their 2002 performances at Minneapolis' First
Avenue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Coon Rapids Dam&lt;/h3&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Coon Rapids dam was built in 1913 by the Northern
Mississippi Power Company. It took 1,000 men just a little over 1
year to complete the entire dam system. During construction, a
small town grew up on the Anoka County side of the river, complete
with barracks, hospitals, fire stations and even dance halls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled in the woods above the river floodplain, the West Coon
Rapids Dam Visitor Center in Brooklyn Park focuses on the Natural
History of the Mississippi River. The park provides safe and easy
access to the river for investigating water quality. Hands-on
programs cover the physical, chemical, and biological health of the
Mississippi River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activities:&lt;/strong&gt; There are extensive trails for
hiking, bicycling, skiing and snowshoeing. Some of the best bird
watching in the metro area can be found in this park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hours:&lt;/strong&gt; Please call for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact Information:&lt;/strong&gt; Call the West Coon Rapids
Dam Visitor Center at (763) 694-7790.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mississippi River Geocache: Poolside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi River Geocache is a series of caches placed
within the &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss"&gt;Mississippi National
River and Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt;, a 72-mile stretch of the Mississippi
River from the cities of Dayton and Ramsey in the north to just
south of Hastings, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the Mississippi River Geocache
series by visiting the park
&lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/geocache.htm"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. This
cache is a joint effort between
&lt;a href="http://www.anokacountyparks.com"&gt;Anoka County Parks&lt;/a&gt;
and the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure to leave comments and any river experiences

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A long time ago a man had a cat that he wanted to get rid of because it would get into trouble all of the time. It would scratch up all of the stuff the man had and it would bite his hand every chance it had. One day the man brought it to Hidden Falls so it could live in the woods. Now every once in a while someone hears strange noises and sometimes the cat will hiss at you. This cat has been known as the Crazy Cat. If you leave a trinket for the cat to play with in the cache the Crazy Cat purrs and is as gentle as a kitten. So have fun and happy hunting. Look for a blue container with a red lid.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Fairmont Creamery opened in 1924. It was the city's first major industry, employing 180 people and pumping $2 million into the local economy.  The creamery in Moorhead was part of the nation-wide network of creameries and buying stations started by Fairmont.  The Moorhead plant was involved in poultry processing, butter making, and buying cream and milk.

The plant was closed in October 1980 because Fairmont Foods was divesting itself of its creamery operations in order to concentrate on its convenience stores.  Cass-Clay Creamery bought the creamery building but sold it to the Anderson-Jordahl Development Company.  

On February 1, 1982 that firm began the renovations needed to change the old creamery into a senior citizens housing project.  This involved the razing of much of the existing structure.  There was a move at this time to have the building placed on the national Register of Historical Properties.  In 1982 Eventide opened a 96 unit assisted living and memory loss complex, which currently occupies the structure.

On February 10, 1983 the Fairmont Creamery was added to the National Registery of Historic Places.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Before you can find the cache, you must come up with the actual
coordinates. The first step you must take is answering this
question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.brooktrout.ca/wrbt2.jpg" alt="Cook's Trout "

&lt;br /&gt;
In 1915, Dr. J.W. Cook was fishing for trout with some friends. One
of his friends that day landed a 14lb. beast, but Cook landed a
14.5lb. giant.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IN WHICH BODY OF WATER DID DR. J.W. COOK CATCH HIS WORLD RECORD
BROOK TROUT IN, IN 1915?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have an answer, take out any spaces you might have and
convert all the letters to their numerical value. (A=1, B=2 etc.)
Once you have done this, put each number into it's formula. The
first letter goes with the first formula, 2nd letter with the
second formula and so on. The order of operations do not matter.
Here are the formulas you will use&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1) A÷2x4+4÷8=&lt;br /&gt;
2) 26-B-2÷3=&lt;br /&gt;
3) Cx2-12÷4x2-10=&lt;br /&gt;
4) 18-D÷3+7÷5-1=&lt;br /&gt;
5) Ex3-6÷3+4=&lt;br /&gt;
6) 10x3÷F+4=&lt;br /&gt;
7) 6x2-11+G÷3=&lt;br /&gt;
8) 43-H÷5-3=&lt;br /&gt;
9) 15-Jx2-8=&lt;br /&gt;
10) K÷2-7+5=&lt;br /&gt;
11) 15÷Lx3-9=&lt;br /&gt;
12) 26+10-M÷3-6=&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have the numbers, put them into these coords. Then you can
find the cache. Hope you have fun and good luck.&lt;br /&gt;

It was called Fred Sims Park Cache.  That cache was placed on 12/7/03 and archived on 8/7/06.

This cache is in the same location as the old one, but a newer, sturdier rivulet perambulation device was installed since the other was archived.
This will give some new cachers a chance to visit this park, and some of us old cachers a chance to revisit the same spot if you found it before.</groundspeak:long_description>

I think it was left over from when the road used to go this direction.

Pretty straight forwad hide.  Bring your own pencil.  Cache is too small to store one.

While rotating my tires recently, I took a walk nearby and found a spot I thought should have a cache. This location is along a paved trail/sidewalk that can be accessed from a number of parking lots nearby via stairs or come the long way if you can't travel stairs.

While searching at GZ don't let anyone drop any red stones on you from above. 

When in the area made sure you go for Planets: Mercury (GC1ET35) nearby

 My fondest memory here is the time I was walking through the park and a police car drove up the walking path toward me, The officer got out and asked me if I had happened to see a cougar go by. I had not spotted it but I kept my eyes open for the rest of my walk. I did come across some cougar tracks and Holly Berrie and I took our kids to make plaster casts of the tracks.</groundspeak:long_description>

In celebration of this dubious achievement, and because we believe there's a writer in everyone, we'd like to see you write a log that is in keeping with the historical journals of the first caches. (In other words, write something that others will enjoy reading.)

Park on the northbound University frontage road.

The cache is a small lock n’ lock box filled with goodies. Remember to always trade even, trade up. And please rehide exactly as you find it to retain its secrecy. Happy hunting and writing!

Congratulations on FTF and FTL (first to log) to Valsey! Great story. And FTF congrats to King Boreas as well!</groundspeak:long_description>

Another muggle-rich area.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
Doing our part to promote clean paths. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This activity that we all enjoy is full of acronyms. We're just
adding to the fun. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Growing up nobody practiced DIPO. Even in our own yards. I remember
finding it on the playgrounds, neighbors’ yards, sandboxes,
beaches, trails. I even remember it being a problem for my
skateboard. And that was 30+ years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now most people that have canines, carry crap containers (bags)
when they walk. This is the whole theme for this series of
geocaches. When you find these caches you should never find the
by-product. Enjoy a clean experience. Your biggest worry for these
will be “legal” parking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache will be very small and contain only a logbook and an FTF
prize. Bring something to write with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FYI, we'll let you each figure out what DIPO stands for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this series, there are 6 DIPO caches plus a FINAL. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6e16a0c9-090f-40ac-877e-3ca081b6ef7a"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=daebff85-b34a-44e8-bcc8-9f5e96e2607a"
   a="&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href="&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6430f9cf-d12b-48e7-a044-6f05b5ecc178"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DIPO6 DIPO Dirty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each of these caches has a number on it. After you've found all the
caches, and all the numbers, you will be able to put them into
coords and find the final DIPO. &lt;br /&gt;
N 45° 01. ABC W 093° 25.FED&lt;br /&gt;
DIPO 1=A&lt;br /&gt;
DIPO 2=B&lt;br /&gt;
DIPO 3=C&lt;br /&gt;
DIPO 4=D&lt;br /&gt;
DIPO 5=E&lt;br /&gt;
DIPO 6 DIPO Dirty=F&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=47233ce9-e70c-4cd3-b990-6b5817f8f725"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Final DIPO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hope you have fun and please do try DIPO while you search&lt;br /&gt;
for our caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Lying at the center of the North American continent, Minnesota embraces three great watersheds – areas of land from which all surface water eventually flows into one united stream.  From Minnesota’s watersheds, water runs off in three directions to three different seas:
•	In the largest of the watersheds, the water flows south through the Mississippi River and its tributaries to the Gulf of Mexico.
•	From northeastern Minnesota and its St. Louis River system, water drains eastward into Lake Superior and moves through the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.
•	In northwestern Minnesota water flows north by way of the Red River of the North and the Rainy River into Canada’s Lake Winnipeg and on to Hudson Bay.

Watersheds are a drainage basin is an extent of land (Think a bowl or funnel) where water from rain or snow melt drains downhill into a body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea or ocean. The drainage basin includes both the streams and rivers that convey the water as well as the land surfaces from which water drains into those channels, and is separated from adjacent basins by a drainage divide such as the crest of a mountain or mountain range.
 Watersheds drain into other watersheds in a hierarchical form, larger ones breaking into smaller ones or sub-watersheds with the topography determining where the water flows. 

These three watersheds have very different physical features:

The St. Louis River watershed is rough, hilly, and heavily wooded.  Many of its streams have swift currents, abound with waterfalls, and rarely overflow their steep rocky banks.  The St. Louis River watershed is 3634 sq. miles and is the largest US River to flow into Lake Superior.  It was primarily created by glacial retreat action during the last part of the Ice Ages.  The retreat of the glaciers had both a "tearing" and sedimentary effect on the landscape creating the deep topography of this region.

The watershed of the Red River of the North lies largely on flat prairie land.  The riverbanks are low and currents sluggish.  Minnesota’s north flowing streams that are a part of this watershed are particularly prone to spring flooding when runoff from melting snow and warm rains in the southern part of the watershed reaches northern areas still frozen over or clogged with ice flows.  The "funnel" that forms this watershed are very shallow and separated by what most would consider to be small ridges or rises rather than the stereotypical mountain ranges of other significant watersheds.

Geologically, The Red River flows across the flat lakebed of the ancient glacial Lake Agassiz, an enormous glacial lake created at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation from meltwaters of the Laurentide ice sheet. As this continental glacier decayed, its meltwaters formed the lake, and over thousands of years sediments precipitated to the bottom of the lakebed. The river itself is very young since it is believed to have began only after Lake Agassiz drained, about 9,500 years ago.  It proceeds across the prairie at a slow meandering rate, dropping less the 1 foot per mile.  As a result, it isn't energetic enough to cut a gorge like many other rivers. In fact, geologically it is very quiet, most of the "effect" of this river actually preceeds the formation of the river, back in the era of Lake Agassiz.

The Mississippi watershed combines features of the other two.  Generally the upper portion is heavily forested, with rolling terrain and swift streams.  Farther down, currents slow and streams meander through open prairies, where they may overflow their banks in times of high water.  This watershed is VERY diverse, with mountain / hill ranges separating this watershed from others in some areas, while simple erosion depressions keep the funnel watershed extant in the other areas.  Geologically, the Mississippi River watershed was primarily influnced, not by glacial action, but rather by plate tectonics.  The Mississippi River Embayment Extends from Southern Minnesota to Lousiana.  It is a smaller rift that was formed nearby the major rift that is believed to have formed as the North American plate broke away from Pangea.  At the time, the sea level was much higher, but as sea levels dropped (thanks to the retreating glaciers to the north) the rift was exposed, creating the Mississippi river (that was of course deeped by subsequent erosion/sedimentation).  The New Madrid Fault runs along this rift, and historically is responsible for the largest earthquakes of 1811-1812, the largest recorded quakes in US History.

The fertile areas along both banks of the Red River of the North were once the bed of a huge glacial lake.  When the last glacier retreated and the lake slowly drained.  The plain left behind contained some of the richest farmlands in North America.  

During the Pleistocene epoch (ice age), huge glaciers covered Canada and advanced into the northern United States, in the region we term the low-lying interior plains, or Central Lowland Plains.  These glaciers are responsible for leaving behind huge amounts of highly fertile sediment, the remains of massive amounts of decomposed material previously locked into the frozen ice.  This rich soil deeply blankets the Central Lowland Plains, an area that extends from central North &amp; South Dakota to the west, the Ohio River to the southeast, Oklahoma to the south, and southern Michigan and Western Ohio to the east (Another way to view the impact is to see the area bounded on the west/south by the Missouri River and on the east/south by the Ohio River).  The glaciers affected the area by creating immense flat areas, literally “scrubbing” the area into a series of gently sloping hills, often with erratics (rocks that were originally part of rock formations hundreds or thousands of miles away) dropped randomly in the rolling fields and plains.  

The flat valley lands were well suited to the new farm machinery of the 1870’s and 1880’s.  Settlers followed the railroads west and sent their huge wheat crops back to the growing flour mills in the Twin Cities.  Many of the “bonanza” farms of the Red River Valley were more than 2,000 acres in size and the largest was more than 30,000 acres.  

Today. Wheat is still grown across the area.  However, instead of the single-cash crops of the 19th and early 20th centuries, today sugar beets, sunflowers, and potatoes are the staple of the Red River Valley agriculture.  Today, instead of single-farmer farms, large-scale operations manage a multitude of farms and employ a variety of seasonal workers.

Logging Requirements:

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We're placing our first cache near where we live.  The Parkway outside our house is perfect territory.  We started working on our first cache earlier this summer.  We came up with a clever idea that on a scale of 1-10 was a perfect "10"!    Unfortunately it was muggled before it was even published.  

This is our second placement for our first cache.  While this too is a clever idea, unlike the first attempt, it's not quite a "10".

Being this is a micro, you will need to bring your own pen to sign the log.

FTF has a chance to take a geocoin or a gold dollar coin.

Good luck - watch out for those crazy bikers.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fort Snelling State Park&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fort Snelling State Park is located at the confluence of the
Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. The Dakota called this place
Ha-Ha Mdo-Te which translates to "junction of two rivers" and from
which the town of Mendota got its name. The park opened in 1962 to
conserve open space and wildlife in the metropolitan area. There
are 18 miles of cross-country skiing trails, 18 miles of hiking
trails, 5 miles of biking trails, golf and canoe rentals,
picnicking, fishing, boating, and swimming. The Thomas C. Savage
visitor center offers exhibits and interactives as well as a
giftshop and restrooms.There is a daily entrance fee of $7.00 or an
annual pass for $25.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hours:&lt;/strong&gt; Please call for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact Information:&lt;/strong&gt; Call Fort Snelling State
Park at 612-725-2724&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mississippi River Geocache: Remnants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located just off the bike/pedestrian trail which
leads from the historic Fort Snelling area to Fort Snelling State
Park and beyond. If you follow the bike/pedestrian trail SW, there
is a footpath that leads down to the Thomas Savage Visitor Center
and the S. Axon Von Bergen Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi River Geocache is a series of caches placed
within the &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss"&gt;Mississippi National
River and Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt;, a 72-mile stretch of the Mississippi
River from the cities of Dayton and Ramsey in the north to just
south of Hastings, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the Mississippi River Geocache
series by visiting the
&lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/geocache.htm"&gt;park website&lt;/a&gt;.
This cache is a joint effort between the
&lt;a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/fort_snelling/index.html"&gt;
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; and the
&lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss"&gt;Mississippi National River and
Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure to leave comments and be a good steward and

The path is marked with "Fire Tacks" reflectors. The best way to see these is by holding your light source near eye level. Just follow the reflectors along until you spot two "tacks" together on the same tree. The cache is a small camo covered Lock-n-Lock container.

So off to the trail, flash lights in hand.

"Daddy I'm getting tired"
"Ruff ruff rufff" (translates as ducks... water... sticks... running)

"Can you carry me"
"Where's the car"
"Are we lost"

"Let's go home and I'll come back again on my own next time."

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache, located in Iron Horse Park, is dedicated to Johnny
Gray, the hero of the Buster Keaton movie "The General." The film,
based on an actual Civil War event, is a classic in both movie
making and railroading history and can be enjoyed by the whole
family. Please be careful of the muggle factor which can run high
in this park at times. Use extreme stealth. There is a small prize
for FTF. Enjoy. Congratulations to mnfishnutz, Dogsbestfriend and
Troutonthebrain for their FTF efforts. Always nice to read your
names!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">NOT AT THE POSTED COORDINATES</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">According to Wikipedia, "transcription" may mean "rewriting a piece
of music, either solo or ensemble, for another instrument or other
instruments than which it was originally intended. Transcription in
this sense is sometimes called arrangement, although strictly
speaking transcriptions are faithful adaptations, whereas
arrangements change significant aspects of the original piece."
&lt;p&gt;I've always thought that transcribing music is an
under-appreciated art. Consequently, I thought I'd share some
transcriptions with you. These are all transcriptions for piano,
which is the instrument I play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, we have a transcription of a very famous piece by
J.S. Bach. This is a transcription by an Italian composer and
virtuoso pianist. Let A equal the BWV number of original Bach
piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/f92dc122-8379-4f24-aef5-bb5a491a77e6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is a transcription of a famous movement of a famous
Haydn Symphony, done by a French composer and virtuoso pianist. Let
B equal the symphony number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/100c15f0-c1c8-4199-a801-fef7ad448920.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is my own arrangement of a movement from Holst's suite
"The Planets." Let C equal the number of the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/cc128f45-7ad9-4113-9ab1-511e96c6ef14.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is Sergei Rachmaninoff's transcription of a famous song.
You may be surprised to learn that Rachmaninoff transcribed this
particular song. Let D equal the number of letters in the last word
of the title of the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/211ed759-c861-49f3-bb57-e47e5a01a3ab.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a transcription of a famous movement from a
famous string quartet by Franz Schubert. The transcription is by a
German composer who time has seemed to forget, unfortunately. Let E
equal the Deutsch number of the original quartet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b01f7eec-89e4-4c50-b77a-c31a125ec091.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache can be found at 44 58.(A+(D to the power of C)-D-C-1),
93 21.(E-A+B-C-D). You can check your answers for this puzzle on
&lt;a href=
"http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=beef15157e1e7e56b3a9db01e8628fc7&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433232463443&amp;amp;name=54686520417274206f66205472616e736372697074696f6e"&gt;
Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;. This cache is part of the &lt;a href=

music series&lt;/a&gt;, and you'll want to take note of the number on the
cache for future reference. No need to go near any railroad tracks
to access the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to markta for letting me steal the basic idea of this
cache. The inspiration for this cache is markta's cache GCM4PH. If

Years ago there was another cache near here that you might remember.  Turns out it was on private property so this cache was moved slightly to keep it on City Parks property.  We remember getting that cache when there had just been a buckthorn eradication project.  Unfortunately the buckthorn is back, thicker than ever.  

This cache is intended to be winter friendly.  If you discover it on the ground, please place up again.  Lots of muggles walking the trails and you will be seen from the trail, so stealth is appreciated.  

There is city parks parking on the other side of the lake.  There are other access trails nearby the cache that lead to corporate buildings.  Do not park in the Lifetouch lots as there is not good access to the trails from there.  

Cache approved by Eden Prairie Parks and Recreation.

start, but be sure to also log it with the actual TB itself. To log
the TB's you grab, &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/track/"&gt;start

helps the TB owners track their tractables.&lt;/p&gt;

to leave a similar type or amount so others can share the same

TB from this cache, log it, and then move it along to a new
cache.&lt;/p&gt;

This is my first puzzle hide and I would like to introduce myself.
K0TLG is my geocaching name as well as my ham radio call sign, I
also answer to the name of Tom, I have 75 finds so far. Geocaching
is new to me; I started 11-15-2009 and quickly found the puzzle
caches to be my favorites. Unemployed I have plenty of time on my
hands for the geocaching. Rocketry, amateur radio, photography,
bird watching, fly fishing, golf and geocaching are my hobbies.
Knees that need repair have slowed my pursuit of some caches but
there are plenty out there that I can get too. Until now my
favorite traditional cache found is GC1YAB4. Committed I am to make
all my hides unique, entertaining and educational. All my 62 years
I have lived in the Puzzle Valley area, growing up in Golden Valley
and now living in Crystal. As an old and long time resident I
remember when a SuperValu in Golden Valley sat on the property now
occupied by the post office, it caught fire 2 times and was in 2
other places before it closed. Subsequent changes have made the
business area unrecognizable from the 50&amp;rsquo;s and 60&amp;rsquo;s. I
graduated in the first class of Cooper High School in 1965, I also
attended Carl Sandburg Junior High the first year it was open.
Intending not to bore you I will bring this to a close and I hope
you enjoy this puzzle and that we run into each other on the
geocaching trails. Geocaching sense would tell you to bring your
own writing tool to this cache.&lt;br /&gt;

Walter a.k.a Red Sochacki was my Phy Ed teacher back in the 50’s.  He traveled between the Robbinsdale School district elementary schools showing up at each one once a week to put terror into the students.   Back in those days the Phy Ed teacher always carried a paddle with several holes (and notches) in it.   Later in his career he was the Phy Ed and Health teacher as well as the wrestling coach at Carl Sandberg Jr. High School.  He also served many terms as the Mayor of Robbinsdale.
This cache is dedicated to him.
Please BYOP to sign the log.

&lt;p&gt;This is a cache to recognize a notable cacher here in the
northwest metro. &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=5720f626-9c10-4ccf-b646-0581e753a713"&gt;
Sharknose Bunnies&lt;/a&gt; (henceforth "SNB") burst onto the caching
scene on June 16, 2009. Barely seven months later, he is one cache
shy of 1,000 finds. If you know him at all, this torrid pace will
not surprise you. While most people would find it &lt;font color=
"#008000"&gt;nice to relax&lt;/font&gt;, SNB would rather spend all
available free time caching. He sets ambitious goals for himself.
An avid puzzler, SNB has a goal to have found 500 puzzles by the
end of 2010. (Hopefully, this cache will bring him one step
closer.) We don't doubt that he'll meet this goal, even if he runs
his geo-mobile off the road in one of the many tragic,
geocaching-related &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;auto blunders&lt;/font&gt;. He's
also a serious FTF hound, although he's been a bit frustrated with
his recent first-to-find pace. (We also hope this cache will help
him in that department.) Here are some thoughts each of us have
about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparkyfry says: "I used to consider myself the master of Puzzle
Valley, but deep down, I know that this self-applied title is not
long for this world. I have been caching for 2.5 years and have a
measly 1,900 caches to show for it. At SNB's current rate, he
should overtake me in a few weeks. Don't even get me started on his
FTF pace. It seems like only yesterday, I was showing him how it's
done on the &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;Magical Mystery Sewer&lt;/font&gt;,
which was only his second FTF. Now he has more than me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bobcam says: "I met SNB only once, but as soon as I saw his
geo-mobile, I knew he had to be an awesome guy. I don't think he'll
catch me as far as finds, but you never know, the guy seems pretty
intense. Sparky is definitely right; SNB is going to overtake him
in no time. As for Sparky being the Master of Puzzle Valley:
&lt;font color="#008000"&gt;It's a flat out lie&lt;/font&gt;. That is clearly
me now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn51 says: "SNB, we haven't even met you yet but your
presence has been profoundly felt. Your meteoric entry into this
sport in June has been awe-inspiring to say the least and may well
have changed the weather patterns of the North Metro; indeed,
caches that you have found stay warm to the touch for hours after
your passing. Our cache pace seems to be &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;for
the birds&lt;/font&gt; compared to yours. Congratulations on finding 1000
caches! We wish you thousands more and for ourselves we hope to
have the opportunity to meet you on the trail someday."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their own peculiar way, mnfishnutz, Troutonthebrain, and
Dogsbestfriend write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c8967760-7dac-4232-a0f2-e6d1f2c85bd5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't ask the rest of us why they chose to write this way. It is,
after all, &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;all about Trout&lt;/font&gt;. Funny
story: they thought they would have SNB fooled with "&lt;font color=
"#008000"&gt;DIPO 1&lt;/font&gt;," but he was clearly no match for their
cache hiding skills.
&lt;p&gt;Seeingitdifferent says that SNB "is lightning quick to the FTF.
If a new cache comes out and I put it on my watch list it seems
like moments later I get a notification that he has found it. My
FTF attempts pale in comparison. Even if I risk one of the many
tragic, geocaching-related &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;auto
blunders&lt;/font&gt; en route to the cache, he'll still beat me!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is the traditional 1,000 finds tribute container, a
silver ammo can. However, we were short on materiel and time, so we
had to improvise. The cache is at a different elevation than the
nearby railroad tracks. &lt;font face="Arial" color="white" size=
"0"&gt;The final number is zero!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you solve the puzzle, add .010 to the latitude and subtract
.001 from the longitude. You can check your answers for this puzzle

Congrats to Brooklyn51 and Hal-oween and son for a quick first too
find. Way to go. Brooklyn51 I have found several of your hides here
in Crystal, Golden Valley area, glad you could find one of mine.
Hal-oween, I have seen you name on many of the caches I have
logged. Glad you found it and I hope to meet both of you
soon.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
The posted coordinates are near the cache, but not on it. Please
don't go to the posted coordinates, as you will end up in the
middle of a pond. Finding the actual coordinates will require some
savvy on-line search engine skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you do find the cache, please put it back exactly as you found
it, and make sure the lid is nice and tight. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ASCII&lt;/b&gt;: An acronym for the American Standard Code for
Information Interchange. It's pronounced: &lt;i&gt;ASS-kee&lt;/i&gt;, and it's
a character-encoding scheme based on the ordering of the English
alphabet. In short: Every possible key-stroke on your keyboard is
represented by a number. Examples:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
M = 77&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
m = 109&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[tab key] = 9&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Binary&lt;/b&gt;: In it's purest, most simple language, the only thing
your computer really understands is two commands: On and Off. On =
1 and Off = 0. Every game you play, every email you send, and every
web site you visit is really nothing but a long stream of 1's and
0's.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find this cache, you'll need to start by decoding this ASCII
string into human readable text.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;Okay, time to take a break from Geocaching to
brush up on our East Asian skills a bit! Be brave! It's not as hard
as it initially sounds, and there are lots of resources out there
to help you. Good luck, or as they say over there: Ganbatte
kudasai! Click on the link to download the audio file and
begin...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href=

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;Alert: You are about to download a file in order
to obtain further details needed to find this geocache. As the
cache owner, I represent that this file is safe to download
although the files needed to complete this geocache have not been
checked by Groundspeak or by the Geocache Reviewer for possible
malicious content. As a result, you are downloading this file at
your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: As of 5/23/10, there is now a second way to find the
location of this cache. Attached to the tag of my geocoin/travel
bug called Ten Ball (reference number TB3HJ56) is the coordinates
for the location of this cache. So if you hate puzzles or are
allergic to foreign languages, you can find the cache if you can
find that travel bug. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on

&lt;p class="style2"&gt;Well, he's done it! Fatherhood and diapers (for

sing his praises that this turned into one of the longest tribute

&lt;p&gt;Bobcam is a man of action. To pay tribute to one of his best
geocaching buddies, Minnesota's #1 geocacher crafted a custom ammo
can, donated two geocoins as an FTF prize for the man of honor,
filled the container with sparkyfry's favorite swag, and took time
from his assault on the geocaching recordbooks to help with the
hide. How's that for tribute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(He offered to help make the puzzle too, but we wanted sparkfry
to find the puzzle this year so we gently guided his efforts along
other lines.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sparkyfry is one of the nicest geocachers you'll ever meet.
He's not chicken to climb a tree for you (don't tell his wife), and
he hardly ever points and laughs when you're looking for a cache
he's already found. He's also an avid puzzler and a talented
musician who keeps cachers in the area busy learning interesting
things they'd never otherwise know. There is evidence he can't fly,
but he uses that ability to our benefit, decorating the landscape
with interesting craters to ponder. Congrats on 2000 finds,
sparkyfry!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Where does one start when talking about Sparkyfry? He is a
dynamic person as well as a dynamic cacher. This is the cacher that
found Magical Mystery Sewer and the Puzzle of all Puzzles in Golden
Valley. His puzzles have made me study music and read poetry. When
I am sitting in my office listening to Chopin it is because of
Sparkyfry. I feel fortunate to have gone on some of the late night
First to Find runs with him. I have learned a lot in the very short
time caching with Him. Congrats on hitting 2000!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Daring man to be who risked his soon-to-be child growing up
fatherless, limb, and marital bliss to chase aptly named
"Confluence: Fargnots Folly" cache buried in the depths of the
cedar swamp, while his very pregnant wife oversaw home remodeling.
Unfortunately he died there, and since we'd forgotten to mark where
his house was we didn't bother to drag the body back to
civilization. Therefore we have no idea who this person is who has
hijacked his geocaching.com account to continue to claim finds in
his name, but it seems a fitting tribute to place this cache in
honor of a geocacher who has claimed to have found 1.6k caches in
1.5 years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Congratulations to Sparky Fry on his 2000 &amp;nbsp;cache
finds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve gotten to know Sparkyfry through phone, e-mail and
best of all through geocaching with him a couple of times.&amp;nbsp;
His enthusiasm is highly contagious and his witty sense of humor
makes caching together really fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider Sparkyfry one of the premier &amp;#8220;puzzlers&amp;#8221;,
but the down side is I can&amp;#8217;t solve but just a very few!?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to more caching good times!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My encounters with Sparkyfry can best be summed up in injuries
that happened or nearly happened while caching with him:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
November '08 - I got frostbitten, three others almost got
frostbitten, and Twood80 nearly got crushed by a Mazzmn.&lt;br /&gt;
February '09 - I injured a finger and lost a fingernail, three
people and one dog nearly went sliding to their dooms off of icy
cliffs.&lt;br /&gt;
October '09 - Four of us were nearly lost forever in the wilderness
while chasing Fargnot's Folly. Thankfully, Twood80 thought to bring
her handyman along and his wilderness survival training saves us
all.&lt;br /&gt;
February '10 - Sparkyfry's annual cliff diving attempt proved more
successful as he managed to safely go flying off the cliff, and
landed in three feet of snow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All in all, Sparkyfry is a great guy and entertaining cacher, but I
have to wonder if he's particularly accident prone or possibly the
world's least effective hitman. I look forward to his continued
caching and hope to see miss Sparkyfry (Littlefry? Sparkytot?)
caching with him some day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sparkyfry, his great attitude, his wealth of knowledge and his
skills at the piano keyboard have made the winter go by quickly for
me as I struggled with his puzzles. He is always quick to help and
seems to know a perfect hint without giving away the solution. I
was pretty casual when I started geocaching but I soon discovered
the Unknown Cache and I was hooked. If it wasn&amp;#8217;t for him I
probably would have had the time to find a job by now. I first met
him at a first to find party one snowy morning, he had his daughter
Rose in toe. Now that is dedication. Congratulations on number 2000
sparkyfry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My dad is pretty cool. He plays that Piano Man song when I get
grumpy, which is really nice. On days that he stays home from work,
he takes me on cool adventures to pine trees, where I watch him
walk around in circles and mumble for a long time, or to parking
lots, where he plays peekaboo with the weird boxes at the bottom of
light poles. That's pretty fun, but I still don't get why he goes
out looking for plastic containers all the time. Sometimes he goes
really far away to find them in the middle of the night. He tells
my mom that they're effteeffs, which I guess is some kind of
special plastic container. But really, why? I mean, I've found lots
of those plastic containers in our own kitchen. It's really easy,
and I'm not even one yet. And when he finds them, he doesn't even
stick them in his mouth or chew on them or anything. He just leaves
them there and we go home. Sometimes my dad is so weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how smart my dad is either. I was watching this TV
show and these guys were diving off cliffs into water, which I
guess makes sense. But that Bunny Guy told me that my dad likes to
dive off cliffs into snow and rocks. I'm only a few months old, but
even I know that's just dumb. And I guess one time he almost cut
his own head off on a really big container. Do you know how he
managed that? Get this: He tried to close the container with his
head still in it! Yeah, I know, I don't know how he's lived so long
either. He had blood all over himself and everything, but even
after all that he just walked away and left that container there
too. I sure hope I have my mom's brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, I feel pretty lucky. My dad stays home and plays
with me a lot and I know he loves me. My mom tells me that he
doesn't get nearly as many plastic containers as he did before I
was born. Which means that he must love me more than plastic
containers. And seeing how much he loves plastic containers, I feel
pretty special. Thanks, Dad!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sparkyfry was my first evidence that I wasn't the only
geocacher in the world. I had less than ten finds to my name, and
DNF'ed a nano hide of his. The next day I had a very kind email
from him offering me a hint if I would like one. I think more than
anything, that sums up what kind of a guy sparkyfry is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, he's a Superstar, with FTFs on some amazingly difficult
caches and a string of achievements that very few geocachers can
lay claim to. But you don't see him driving around in a black
Mercedes all pimped up with bling-bling like other famous
geocachers. Why, if you walked by him on the street, you wouldn't
even know he had all those Olympic Geocaching Medals that he keeps
telling everyone about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet with all that fame he reached out to a struggling
unknown and offered to help. And that's just a classy thing to
do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way to go, Sparkyfry! Congrats! Here's to your next 2,000!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="color:#446C1B"&gt;PRIZE FOR THE FIRST GROUP OF TEN OR
MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is dedicated to all cachers who cache in groups...or
have cached in groups...or may one day cache in a group. This cache
is published to coincide with the MnGCA Breakfast Buddies meeting
April 24 at Fat Nats.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a prize within the cache for SOMEBODY in a group of ten or
more to find the cache. To claim the prize, all in the group must
find the cache and then face off in a winner-take-all Elimination
Paper-Rock-Scissors tournament. It's round-robbin style so break
off in groups of two or three and play until all but one has been
eliminated. Sounds simple enough. Enjoy the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a keepsake for the actual FTF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Careful retrieval and replacement will ensure the long-term
viability of this cache. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to the FTF trio. Kudos to Brooklyn51 and
Tomatoes1999 for their milestone finds. Finally, way to go Pippin
for your monumental win in the Paper Rock Scissors face-off. We
wish we could have been there with all of you. I have to say that
the BB crew were great sports going to find this cache considering
the wet weather and likely muddy conditions. Thanks so much.</groundspeak:long_description>

If a TB is left at this cache (ammo can) with a valid &lt;span class=
"SpellE"&gt;Stargate&lt;/span&gt; address, the TB will be transported to
that specified &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Stargate&lt;/span&gt; TB Cache (for
example: if &amp;ldquo;P3898&amp;rdquo; is included in the log entry or on
a physical note attached to the TB, that TB will arrive at the
&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Stargate&lt;/span&gt; P3898 TB Cache). If the TB is
left without a valid &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Stargate&lt;/span&gt; address,
or has an invalid address, it will be transported to a cache that
best advances its goal (in the cache owner&amp;rsquo;s opinion). If
travel via the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Stargate&lt;/span&gt; Network will
hinder the TB's goal(s), the TB's travel orders will be
revoked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a TB owner doesn&amp;rsquo;t want their TB to travel the
&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Stargate&lt;/span&gt; network, quickly contact
&lt;span class="GramE"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; (Team Dogs) and I&amp;rsquo;ll revoke its
traveling orders. If the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;cacher&lt;/span&gt;
dropping off the TB doesn&amp;rsquo;t want the TB to travel the
&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Stargate&lt;/span&gt; network, include this
information in the cache log (both paper and web). The TB will be
assigned local support duty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While this cache is themed to Travel Bugs, there still a log and
trade goods to welcome all &lt;span class=

(*) TBs traveling overseas, or to other countries, may require
multiple wormhole trips to intermediate &lt;span class=
"SpellE"&gt;Stargates&lt;/span&gt; to complete their mission. Additionally,
a Zero Point Module (ZPM) may be required. Logistics to arrange
multiple trips and/or to secure a ZPM may take several weeks or
more. If the TB&amp;rsquo;s Commanding Officer (i.e., owner) does not
want the TB to volunteer for such a lengthy, long-distance mission,
just quickly contact the owner of originating &lt;span class=
"SpellE"&gt;Stargate&lt;/span&gt; TB Cache (me, Team Dogs, for P4493) and
they will revoke the TB&amp;rsquo;s travel orders - and reassign the TB
to local support duties (i.e., redirect the TB to local
caches).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is NOT a TB Hotel. Take as many TBs with local missions
as you can reasonably help along. Leave as many TBs as you deem
proper. DO NOT attempt one-for-one TB swaps, or trading anything
for TBs for that matter. Normal trade rules apply for non-TB
items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Letter Gothic Std, Medium"&gt;"Cacheman: Good job on
saving the governor's daughter at the bridge, but we now have found
the muggle's secret lair. His lair is where he and other muggles
hide out. We also believe that this is where he brings muggled
caches but we have no evidence to prove that. Go to these
coordinates and capture Muggle. Good luck Cacheman. The city of
Cachum needs you."&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Letter Gothic Std, Medium"&gt;As with most lair visits,
your choice of footwear is important. Many times of the year this
site is moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Congratulations FTF group including Golden Aya, freiguy, n0rug, and
tomatoes1999, and Sharknose Bunnies. We had fun visiting during the
search!&lt;br /&gt;

Great job to Rebelex and Gpcat for their Co-FTF. You guys are impressive!

Okay, so most geocachers are having little to no trouble finding my hide. Instead of marking it down to an appropriate difficulty, I will keep it at the "4". Consider it a gift towards your stats.

&lt;h2&gt;Lexi is my 5 year old grand daughter and on April 8th I am
going to take her Geocaching for the first time. I placed this
cache in a small park for her to find. I do not want her to be the
FTF so please go ahead and find it as soon as possible. I do ask
that you leave the $1 bill that is in the cache for her so that she
can get excited about the sport. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Hagemeister Pond Preserve is a beautiful Crystal park.  We first discovered this park when we started caching back in the spring of 2007.  Make sure that you check out the wonderful wood carvings at the entrance on 41st Avenue North.  And the Hagemeister Overlook is also a sight to see.

There is a walking trail that goes all around the park thanks to a floating boardwalk across the pond.  It is home to many waterfowl including a pair of blue herons.  There are even deer that make this preserve their home, there was one watching me place the cache from not very far away without fear.

Enjoy your visit to this great jewel of a park in Crystal from sunrise to 10:00 pm.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Remember to obey park rules and park hours. I made this a two for difficulty because of the number of people who come to this park. No swings or slides, but lots of natural wild life to enjoy. So if you see some muggles coming, just pretend you're bird watching or frog watching. Frogs like to be watched too! That's what one told me. Then dig out the cache. Please return as you found it.  Have fun!!  Cache just contains a sparkle bug and a log. I think I put in a pencil, but bring one anyways.    Sparkyfry gets FTF in14 minutes. Do you have a jetmobile?</groundspeak:long_description>

Nice easy find for the whole family. Just don't forget to not wee
on the greenway. At least until after you find the cache, but its
still not a good idea with all the traffic. I put a pen in this
small also. Good Luck Hunting!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Plenty of quality beacons and a number of great hidey spots but only one was chosen to hold the good geocaching seal of approval. 

This container is on the small side of regular but holds an FTF prize, the regular necessary stuff, some swag from the kids and a trackable. 

Enjoy the nonsense and keep on cachin'.

***You can retrieve this with one hand but please use two to replace it.***

We really enjoy it when our caches get people to alter their plans. Congrats FreiGuy for your FTF here. We'd have paid cash money to watch you rehide the container.</groundspeak:long_description>

NOTE:  We had to give up on neighbor Bob's container idea.  He was using pinecones surrounding narrow plastic tubes as the camo and hung it in an evergreen.  Thus the name "Boy Scout Wreath".  However, squirrels kept destroying the containers, including the 3rd one which he coated in epoxy to try to keep them away.  After that we decided to give up.  Bobcam found the log after the last container was destroyed on 2/20/10 placed it in a new camoed micro size container and rehid it for us.  We'll leave it at that for now and see how well that one survives.  Thanks Bobcam!</groundspeak:long_description>

2,500 find and 50 hide club. As of December 1, 2009 only 18
Minnesota cachers have joined this exclusive club.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Minnstars is a caching machine. He also continues to give back to
the caching community as evidenced by his 2009 WNC tribute cache
event and his very high "cache karma." For Minnstars, his "cache
karma" is .7 - meaning that for every 100 of his finds, about 70
cachers have found his hides. Few cachers have better ratios. To
top it off, he's a great cacher, provides great advice and fun to
cache with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Minnstars, for all you do, this cache is for you!&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

xml:lang="EN"&gt;Our hobbies are geocaching, reading books, going to
Civil War battlefields, traveling and collecting lapel pins. We
have eclectic passions: arts &amp;amp; crafts, American history,
geocaching and visiting cemeteries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is accessible from the road; there is no need to enter
private property. Also, there is a number on the cache somewhere
which you probably want to take note of for future reference. 
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm sick of zombies and other undead creatures. One
too many drunken frat boys urinating in public during a zombie pub
crawl has eliminated any affection I may have once had for the
lovable creeps. Even the caliber of zombie movies – which, as far
as I can tell, spawned the whole zombie phenomenon – has
deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone are the halcyon days when movies like &lt;i&gt;C.H.U.D.&lt;/i&gt;
frightened us. Instead, we’re being subjected to movies like the
recent &lt;i&gt;Dawn of the Dead&lt;/i&gt; – remakes of timeless classics with
the life completely drained out of the film. (No pun intended.)
Similarly, &lt;i&gt;Re-Animator&lt;/i&gt; has been replaced by
&lt;i&gt;Zombieland&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/i&gt; has been replaced by film
“adaptations” of zombie-ish video games, like &lt;i&gt;Doom&lt;/i&gt;. George
Romero is even still churning zombie movies out. Apparently, his
&lt;i&gt;Land of the Dead&lt;/i&gt; wasn’t half bad, but you do get the sense
he’s just cashing in on the current popularity of zombies, which
you know will soon go the way of Beanie Babies, Mambo No. 5, and
Crystal Pepsi. There are even zombie books now. I can’t think of
one possible reason for something called &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice and
Zombies&lt;/i&gt; to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had enough. I call a moratorium on watching or reading
anything zombie related that is less than ten years old. I’m going
all the way back to &lt;i&gt;I Walked With A Zombie&lt;/i&gt;. Heck, maybe I’ll
go all the way to &lt;i&gt;Nosferatu&lt;/i&gt;. Nothing later than &lt;i&gt;Army of
Darkness&lt;/i&gt; for me. &lt;i&gt;Return of the Living Dead&lt;/i&gt; might work in
a pinch, or even &lt;i&gt;The Ghost Breakers&lt;/i&gt;. (Who knew Bob Hope was
in a movie about zombies?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, except I might see &lt;i&gt;Mutant Vampire Zombies from the
Hood&lt;/i&gt;. That movie looks awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The Rum River is a slow, meandering channel that connects
Minnesota's Mille Lacs Lake with the Mississippi River. It runs
through the farming communities of Milaca, Princeton, Cambridge,
and Isanti before ending at the Twin Cities suburb of Anoka,
roughly 20 miles northwest of downtown Minneapolis.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Dakota name for the river is Wakpa wakan (Spirit(ual)/Mystic
River), after Mille Lacs Lake (Mde wakan, Spirit(ual)/Mystic Lake).
In 1702, d'Isle's map recorded the name of the river as Riviere des
Mendeoüacanton (River of the Mdewakanton). On the 1733 Henry Popple
map, the Rum River is shown as R. Nendivaocanton. Upham notes that
both Carver in 1766 and Pike in 1805 found the name "Rum River" in
use by English-speaking fur traders. However, the 1778 Mitchell Map
by John Mitchell records the river as Fiume del Lago ("River of the
Lake"), with Samuel Mitchell reproducing the map in 1880, with the
river recorded as Lake R.; Mille Lacs Lake, though, was recorded in
the reproduction as Red Lake or Mustiacalsan ("Mustiacalsan" being
a mis-recording of "Milsilacaigon"). By 1832, Tanner's map recorded
the name of the river as Missisagaigon or Rum River. Today, two
different Ojibwe names can be found this river: one indicating the
lake of its origin (Misi-zaaga'igani-ziibi, Grand Lake River) and
the other reflecting the English (Ishkodewaaboo-ziibi, Fire-water
River).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early Explorer Father Louis Hennepin is credited with being
the first European to lay eyes upon the Rum. He was taken to see it
during the spring of 1680, while under the captivity of a party of
Dakota. He referred to it as the St. Francis river in his published
journals, although obviously the name didn't stick. The current
river bearing the name St. Francis River, located 12 miles west of
the Rum, parallels the flow of the Rum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rum River makes a sharp turn southward at Cambridge,
Minnesota. During the Spring floods, the Rum River forces itself
through a wetland complex west of Cambridge as the sharp bend
constricts the river's floodwaters. In the 1825 Treaty of Prairie
du Chien, the outlet of this natural diversion channel located near
Isanti, Minnesota, known as "Choking Creek", became a treaty
boundary separating the Dakota from the Ojibwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

alt="Rum River Damn in 1908" style="border-width:0px;" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Princeton, Minnesota, the Rum divides between the Main Branch
and the West Branch. When Mille Lacs County, Minnesota was created
from Benton County, Minnesota, the West Branch of the Rum served as
the Counties' boundary. Today, Mille Lacs County's western boundary
instead follows a survey line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bogus Brook, which flows into the Rum River, was known to
have been a refuge for moonshiners during the Prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rum River was added to Minnesota's Wild &amp;amp; Scenic Rivers
Program in 1978. The designated stretch extends along Mille Lacs,
Sherburne, Isanti and Anoka counties. The Rum River has segments in
all three "wild", "scenic", and "recreational" classifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;General river characteristics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be eligible for inclusion in the Minnesota Wild and Scenic
rivers system, a river or segment of a river, and its adjacent
lands must possess outstanding scenic, recreational, natural,
historical, scientific, or similar values. The river or its
segments shall be classified into one or more of the three classes
of rivers: wild, scenic, and recreational. Each river shall be
managed so as to preserve and protect the values which qualify it
for designation and classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Classification: Wild&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild rivers are those that exist in a free-flowing state with
excellent water quality and with adjacent lands that are
essentially primitive. Wild rivers should not be paralleled by
conspicuous and well-traveled roads or railroads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Classification: Scenic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenic rivers are those rivers that exist in a free-flowing
state and with adjacent lands that are largely undeveloped (i.e.,
adjacent lands still present an overall natural character, but in
places may have been developed for agricultural, residential, or
other land uses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Classification: Recreational&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recreational rivers are those rivers that may have undergone
some impoundment or diversion in the past and that may have
adjacent lands which are considerably developed, but that are still
capable of being managed so as to further the purposes of this act.
This means that bordering lands may have already been developed for
a full range of agricultural or other land uses, and may also be
readily accessible by pre-existing roads or railroads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions to answer to gain credit for this Earth Cache:&lt;br /&gt;
1) What is the river classification for the stretch of river that
you are standing on?&lt;br /&gt;
2) What is the water level in inches below the falls? (There is a
giant ruler on the opposite shore) &lt;i&gt;What this ruler is showing is
inches above flood stage. you do not need to use the altimeter on
your GPS to figure this one out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3) &lt;s&gt;What is the difference in cms of the water level above the
falls and below the falls. (you can see two different rulers by the
spill way on the east side of the river)&lt;/s&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4) Post a picture of the waterfalls so everyone can view its
progress through out the year. (optional)&lt;/p&gt;

alt="View of the Falls" style="border-width:0px;" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A waterfall is a place where flowing water rapidly drops in
elevation as it flows over a steep region or a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, a river flows over a large step in the rocks that may
have been formed by a fault line. As it increases its velocity at
the edge of the waterfall, it plucks material from the riverbed.
This causes the waterfall to carve deeper into the bed and to
recede upstream. Often over time, the waterfall will recede back to
form a canyon or gorge downstream as it recedes upstream, and it
will carve deeper into the ridge above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the rock stratum just below the more resistant shelf will
be of a softer type, meaning that undercutting due to splashback
will occur here to form a shallow cave-like formation known as a
rock shelter or plunge pool under and behind the waterfall.
Eventually, the outcropping, more resistant cap rock will collapse
under pressure to add blocks of rock to the base of the waterfall.
These blocks of rock are then broken down into smaller boulders by
attrition as they collide with each other, and they also erode the
base of the waterfall by abrasion, creating a deep plunge pool or
gorge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img title="Click for Larger Image" src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0a36f934-2e2a-4175-9c2b-8a8948d04a94.jpg"
alt="Formation of Waterfall" style="border-width:0px;" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streams become wider and shallower just above waterfalls due to
flowing over the rock shelf, and there is usually a deep pool just
below the waterfall because of the kinetic energy of the water
hitting the bottom. Waterfalls normally form in a rocky area due to
erosion. After a long period of being fully formed, the water
falling off the ledge will retreat, causing a horizontal pit
parallel to the waterfall wall. Eventually, as the pit grows
deeper, the waterfall collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterfalls can occur along the edge of a glacial trough, whereby
a stream or river flowing into a glacier continues to flow into a
valley after the glacier has receded or melted. The large
waterfalls in Yosemite Valley are examples of this phenomenon. The
rivers are flowing from hanging valleys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This natural process has been halted here in Anoka because of
the damn that was built. If nature had been allowed to run its
course the waterfall here would continue to move upstream until
eventually wearing down to a small rapids.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Picnic at Hanging Rock, was an Australian novel written back in 1967, by Joan Lindsay. It became a staple literary book studied in high schools in Australia. My turn at reading this book was half hearted to say the least... a bunch of private school boarding school girls go missing on a field trip... woohoo!

Needless to say I fudged the class.

The movie made from the story was popular in Australia, and it was served up to us in the class. I can't say I cared for it much.

The movie really was made popular because the final chapter that unravelled the mystery and suspense of the book was pulled from the script, and remained unpublished in the initial editions of the book. In Australia, it provided food for discussion (probably because the book became a popular school text) with people wondering what happened. The chapter was finally printed as a separate publication posthumously, in 1987. 

The ending to me was completely underwhelming and weird. 

But then again, I was a guy who at that time couldn't stand literature. 

Supposedly it is a good book - to those who propose to know - so if you feel so inclined try and lay hands on a copy.

Otherwise, just have fun with the cache and the not so subtle clue buried in the title.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Just face it. You may have an obsession. You
should seek help overcoming it. You might need to admit that there
is a problem. You are, quite possibly, addicted to
geocaching.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Answering the following questions may help to put your
relationship with geocaching in perspective for you. If you end
up&lt;br /&gt;
answering "yes" to three or more questions, you probably need to
take a good look how your life is affected by geocaching.&lt;/p&gt;
1) Do you crave geocaching as soon as you wake up?&lt;br /&gt;
2) Have you tried to give up geocaching and failed?&lt;br /&gt;
3) Have you missed classes, work, or church because of
geocaching?&lt;br /&gt;
4) Have you ever taken a detour on your way to work, or home from
work just so you could find a geocache?&lt;br /&gt;
5) Do you plan your vacation route based on cache density and and
take the "scenic" route so that you can go through another state
that isn't red yet on your cache map?&lt;br /&gt;
6) Can you drive past a Dollar Store or Army Surplus Store without
thinking about geocaching?&lt;br /&gt;
7) When you are in a store, you look at every hollow object as a
potential cache container?&lt;br /&gt;
8) Everywhere you go, are you always looking for a hiding
spot?&lt;br /&gt;
9) Do you get really excited when you find a new park?&lt;br /&gt;
10) Are you familiar with words like, 'gerr' 'ybt' 'fghzc' 'ebpx'
'gur' 'oruvaq' 'zntargvp', and 'citengam'?&lt;br /&gt;
11) Have you had to explain to your significant other why there is
a sudden shortage of Lock-N-Lock containers in the kitchen?&lt;br /&gt;
12) Is your driveway covered with spray painted ammo box
silhouettes?&lt;br /&gt;
12) Do you no longer visualize/think of the city in terms of
streets and addresses but rather cache locations?&lt;br /&gt;
13) Are the top 10 speed dial numbers on your cell all phone
a&lt;br /&gt;
friends?&lt;br /&gt;
14) Do you always carry a caching toolkit filled with cache repair
and cache retrieval equipment in the car but have no idea where the
spare tire or jumper cables are?&lt;br /&gt;
15) Do you find yourself checking under light pole skirts, under
telephones and behind guardrails even though you don't have your
GPSr with you, just in case?&lt;br /&gt;
16) Do you check the geocaching.com website more than once a
day?&lt;br /&gt;
17) Do you often wish people would just mind their own business
about you and geocaching?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're here to help. This cache is a test to see how addicted to
geocaching you really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your goal is to not find this cache!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that there are those among us (and you know who you
are!) who, when they look at the page showing their 25 nearest
caches, see nothing but a perfect page full of finds. Then that new
cache comes along and spoils your pristine page. It sits there at
the top of the list. Taunting you. Staring at you like a giant
unblinking eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It calls out to you. "Fiiiind meeee..." You comply, even though
the sun is barely peeking over the horizon. If you're lucky, you
score a First to Find, and then race back to log it in and remove
it from your top 25 list. Ahhhhh. Order again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, how strong are you? Can you resist searching
out this cache?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have nothing substantive to gain from finding it. There is
no invigorating hike. There are no breathtaking views. There are no
cool first finder tokens to find or other cool pieces of cache swag
to trade for. In fact, the cache contains nothing but a logsheet.
The cache is hidden in a rather boring, non-imaginative way. This
idea isn't even original. A photo of the hiding location is even
below to show you where it is. Even the text is blatantly
plagiarized from several similar ones!&lt;/p&gt;
The cache, which is white in color, is hidden against the tree
trunk shown in this picture about six feet up or so...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b100a180-f1b3-4f31-a203-03c92f906f7a.jpg"

width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing you have to gain from searching out this cache is
just adding another find to your total. Show the world how strong
you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can stop geocaching anytime you want. Really you
can...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;By logging this cache, you are making a
public profession that YOU do indeed have a geocaching
addiction!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="style1"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/7de121e2-4bc5-46c6-a87e-779ec072de6a.jpg"
width="600" height="439" /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;This should be a quick, three-stage
multi-cache at a rather unique spot in Golden Valley. This is the
kind of place you can drive by a hundred times a year and never
give more than a passing glance. Please respect the setting and the
sacrifices of those lying inside. Note that although this cache
involves a cemetery, it is designed so that you can do the whole
multi-cache without having to set foot inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;The questions are simple enough that young
children with moderate reading skills can figure out the answers,
and you can most efficiently walk the distances between the three
stages. Please be careful crossing the streets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="style3"&gt;To Find the Cache:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;The posted coordinates will take you to
Stage 1. Once you get there, look due west. You will see a
condiment and a food. Count the number of letters in the condiment.
Count the number of letters in the food. Add them together. For
example, if the condiment and food were PIZZA and RELISH, your
answer would be 11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;Next, go to the Stage 2 coordinates: N 45
00.405 W 093 22.828. Look west again. You will see an explanation
about this location. In one of the words is a body part. Add up the
total number of letters in that entire word. For example, if the
word were HEADSTART, your answer would be 9.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;To find the final, add up the number of
letters from Stage 1 and Stage 2. In our example, the answer would
be 20. This is your TOTAL. To find the final stage, do the
following math:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;NORTH ANSWER = (TOTAL x 10) + 226.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;WEST ANSWER = (TOTAL x 10) + 658&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;The Final Stage is located at: N 45 00.(NORTH
ANSWER) W 93 22.(WEST ANSWER)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p align="left" class="style2"&gt;You'll need to bring your own
writing implement, and use stealth as the cache is in a fairly busy
location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" class="style2"&gt;Good luck, have fun, and happy
caching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

1.  What is the elevation?

2.  Where was the original Red River channel located?  When was the Red River rerouted?

3.  Trace the flow of the Red River from its origin at Lake Traverse to its draining point into Lake Winnipeg.

4.  Describe how the elevation drops from the Red River’s source to Lake Winnipeg.  How many inches per mile is this?


This Earthcache is located at the Veterans Memorial bridge that spans the Red River and separates Fargo from Moorhead and North Dakota from Minnesota.  Please park on the Moorhead side along 4th Street and take the pedestrian walk to the site.  Enjoy!

The Wisconsin glaciation occurred somewhere between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago.  During this last ice age, the northern part of North America was covered by a glacier.  As the ice sheet started to break apart and melt, it sent strong and fast-moving streams of water southward.  This water dammed up behind a barrier of glacial debris known as the Big Stone Moraine and pooled into a lake larger than all the Great Lakes combined.   

About 13,000 years ago, this gigantic lake, once known as Lake Agassiz, covered present-day Manitoba, western Ontario, eastern Saskatchewan, northern Minnesota, and eastern North Dakota.  At its greatest extent, the lake covered up to 440,000 square kilometers--roughly the size of Uzbekistan or Iraq.  Lake Agassiz was much larger than any current lake in the world, including the Caspian Sea, and held more water than contained by all lakes in the world today.  At its maximum, Lake Agassiz was over 300 feet deep--where downtown Fargo and Moorhead sit today.

The lake drained at various times and in all directions.  It drained south through the Traverse Gap into the Glacial River Warren, east through present-day Lake Nipigon (then Lake Kelvin) to present-day Lake Superior, and west through the Mackenzie River through the Yukon Territory and Alaska.  It is believed that around 13,000 BP there was a major flood of the Lake, causing it to drain through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River into the Atlantic Ocean.  

Climatologists believe this flood and draining may have been the cause of the Younger Dryas stadial.  The Younger Dryas stadial, also known as the Big Freeze, was a geologically brief period of time (about 1300 years) in which the climate returned to ice age conditions.  The return of ice for sometime offered a bit of a reprieve for the Lake.  About 9900 years ago, after the ice sheet retreated north of the Canadian border and slowly melted, Lake Agassiz refilled.  These events of Lake Agassiz had a significant impact on climate, sea level, and possible early human civilization.

The majority of the final drainage of Lake Agassiz occurred within a very short amount of time--about a year.  A recent study by Turney and Brown links this rapid drainage (and subsequent global seal level rise of about one meter) to the expansion of agriculture in Europe.  This study also suggests that this drainage and previous flooding may also account for various flood myths of prehistoric cultures, including the Biblical flood.

The last major shift in the drainage of Lake Agassiz took place about 8400 years before present.  During this time, the lake took up its current watershed and slowly drained into the Hudson Bay.  Over the next 1000 years, the Lake drained completely.  

Lake Winnipeg, Lake Winnipegosis, Lake Manitoba, and Lake of the Woods are relics of the ancient Lake Agassiz.  Other geological and geomorphological evidence for Lake Agassiz can also be seen today.  Raised beaches, many miles from any water, mark the former boundaries of the lake at various times.  Several modern river valleys, including those of the Assiniboine River and the Minnesota River, were originally cut by water entering or leaving the lake.  The fertile soils of the Red River Valley, which are some of the richest in the world, are formed from deposits of silt from Lake Agassiz.  Fargo-Moorhead currently sits on 105 feet of sediments deposited by Lake Agassiz.  

The Red River started to form about 9000 years ago in the Fargo-Moorhead area as Lake Agassiz drained northward.  The Red River flows across the flat lakebed of Lake Agassiz.  The Red River Valley, which is one of the flattest landscapes on Earth, is situated on this ancient lakebed.  From its origin near Breckenridge, Minnesota to the international border near Emerson, Manitoba, the Red River Valley slopes only about one foot per mile.  The river, which flows slowly and is small most of the time, does not have the energy to cut a deep gorge.  Instead, it curves and beds across the low-lying lands as it moves north.

&lt;p&gt;This cache will bring you to Downtown Spooner, WI. The
Centennial park has been recently renovated.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have considered placing a cache here for quite some time, glad I
waited because it was completely redone , including landscaping and
rest rooms. This cache will require stealth, and depending on the
time of the year may be very difficult to get close to it. During
some of the summer celebration events held downtown , this area
could be full to the limit with muggles. So plan accordingly and
avoid some of these real busy times. Cache is a small container
with log sheet only, there may be room for small trade items.
Please bring your own pen or pencil. Please replace the container
exactly where it was placed. I encourage you to support the
downtown merchants but don't bother them with questions on this
cache, they are in no way involved with this hide. This location
looks like it could be wheel chair accessible and should be winter
friendly. Finally , PLEASE don't disturb the new shrubs or flowers
planted in the park. It is not necessary to go near them. Cache is
within the confines of the park, do not go on private property.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tadpole Corners, is a landmark in Washburn county. This location
has long been known for the old school house that sits on the
corner and now a storage unit across the road. It is seldom used
any more but for an occasional thrift sale or community meeting. I
noticed in a plat book dated in 1915 that the original corner was
several hundred feet to the west. It seems that county road "K" was
at that time on the west side of the swamp land, the old road bed
is still visible in the early spring. 
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a waterproof match container, contains log book and
pencil. Cache is winter friendly. Please replace this back
carefully and re-hide as well as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cache placed Memorial Day 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;So who was the first Civil War volunteer for the Union Army? As
an Australian, such facts appear trivial and merely a minor detail
in the whole grand picture of the events that took place during the
war. However, a chance discovery while geocaching revealed that
facts like this are not trivial, but are actually fought over in
the annals of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is the first? If the memorial located at this park is to
be believed, it is Aaron Greenwald, of Anoka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0f128e3b-c875-443d-9ad0-e80a69be9da2.jpg"
target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0f128e3b-c875-443d-9ad0-e80a69be9da2.jpg"
width="550" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is somewhat disputed. St Paul has a statue
memorializing one Josiah King, who is the other claimant to this
'title' (if that is what we could call it). The reason for the
dispute? Well, I need to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josiah King has been the main claimant to the honor of first to
volunteer, as he was the first person to record his name in a book
of St Paul militiamen willing to fight for the Union. This request
was made on the evning of April 15, 1861. Little about this is in
dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on April 15, 1861, former Governor Gorman received a
telegram message, from the then Governor Ramsey, regarding his
offer to President Lincoln to provide a thousand volunteers for the
war. Gorman that morning was in the Anoka court defending a
criminal case. He used a recess in the proceedings to make an
impromptu speech before those gathered. The request for volunteers
was given, and seven men volunteered, the first of whom was Aaron
Greenwald, a miller from Anoka. This took place at 10am, prior to
the request made in St Paul that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proving the claim of Greenwald is difficult, as precious little
written evidence is to be found. That would appear inconsequential
to the Anoka County Historical Society, who in placing this
memorial are seen to make the claim absolute, proven and final!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Council, headquartered in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis/St. Paul,
serves more than 95,000 young people in 21 counties across central
Minnesota and four counties in western Wisconsin. The council is
among the five largest in the United States and is led by over
23,000 volunteers. More than 1,100 community organizations,
representing educational, religious, non-profit, civic, and
business organizations join in partnership with Northern Star
Council by chartering 1,746 Scouting units (packs, troops, teams,
crews, posts and groups). The Northern Star Council is the result
of the July 1, 2005 merger of the former Viking (Minneapolis) and
Indianhead (St. Paul)
Councils.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

has led to many urban legends. We've heard that he's buried in
Giants Stadium, in the Florida Everglades, in a New Jersey
landfill, in a Central Sanitation shredder, and in cement beneath
various freeways, bridges and buildings from Michigan to New York.
Well, we're here to clear it up once and for all.
&lt;p&gt;On July 30, 1975, Jimmy drove his car to the Machus Red Fox
Restaurant in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. Believing the mafia
was about to whack him, he swapped cars and got out of town. (He
had access to lots of untraceable cars.) He knew they might still
find him, so he took some files he had as dirt on the mobsters, as
an insurance policy. He cleverly concealed the goods inside his
car. He made his way west through Chicago, intending to hide out on
a ranch in Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for him, the mafia caught up with him as he was
driving through Golden Valley, Minnesota. He sped up, but they were
gaining on him! On Golden Valley Road, he lost control of his
vehicle near the bridge over the Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Railroad, and plunged into a ravine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of the crash killed him instantly. The mobsters went
down after him and removed his body. They knew he had some dirt on
them, but they couldn't find the goods!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you find the goods that Jimmy hid in his car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;LETTERBOX DESCRIPTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park near the intersection of Manor Drive and Crestview Avenue
North. To the southeast, you will see the trail entrance. There are
actually two trails. Take the one on the right, and it will take
you downhill. Go downhill until you come to another trail, and take
a right so that you're walking alongside the pond. Follow that
trail as it curves to the left. The trail splits off; follow the
trail to the right. Keep close to the pond, all the while staying
on a trail. Keep the pond on your right. You'll get to sort of a
trail; you'll see a sewer drain on your left, but keep walking
straight. The trail curves to the right, and the pond should be
only about 20 feet to your right now. You'll walk by a tree that's
fallen over and has the phrase "15 Missouri Hip Hop" painted on it,
as well as a big rock that has white spray paint on it. You'll keep
walking with the pond immediately to your right. At this point, you
should see the remains of Jimmy's car. Face the inside of the car
with the lake behind you. You'll see a hole inside the car to the
right. Reach around in there and back to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

"Comic Sans MS"&gt;At this particular location, an Eagle Scout service
project was conducted in 2003 by an Eagle Scout from Troop 142,
serving the Wyoming community, which consisted of constructing a
six sided Gazebo on the Sunrise Trail. This project was completed
with the help of 15 volunteers who spent a total of 260 hours on
this project. The total cost of this project was
$1847.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="227030215-08012009"&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#008000"
face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;Nearby on the Sunrise Trail you will see the
first of 4 benches provided by an Eagle Scout from Troop 142 of
Wyoming in 2005.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="227030215-08012009"&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#008000"
face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;In front of the Library located across highway
61 is an Eagle Project also completed by another Eagle Scout in
2006 from Troop 142. This project consisted of the installation of
the flagpole and landscaping nearby. The total cost of the project
was $3711 and consisted of 24 people volunteering 209
hours.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="227030215-08012009"&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#008000"
face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;Step a little to the west and you will see a
rain garden Eagle Project constructed by an Eagle Scout from Troop
142 in 2009.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="227030215-08012009"&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#008000"
face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;Finally, step inside the library and you will
see an Eagle Project completed by an Eagle Scout from Troop 142 in
2007. This project is a dividing wall shaped like a train to
separate the entry area from the children's area. The 'wall' also
holds computers on the children's side. This project involved 5
volunteers who spent 250 hours working on this project with a cost
of $250.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="227030215-08012009"&gt;&lt;font size="3" color="#008000"
face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;When you visit this Cache to Eagle, be sure to
record the keyword on the log. When you have found all 12 Cache to
Eagle locations in the Many Waters District (more to be placed
soon), you can email the keywords associated with each cache to the
Grey Wolf and Wild Rice to receive a Cache to Eagle patch if you
would like one. Supplies are limited.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Congratulations Valsey and Reptileking on your co-FTF!  I enjoyed watching the FTF search from a distance.  :  )</groundspeak:long_description>

I was disappointed to not find the original, and was planning to hide one here once it was archived (less than a mile from my house) but I was pleasantly surprised to see one got here before I hid it. Maybe there's room for another ;)</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Located along the shores of Lake Superior, along the three mile
long boardwalk and biking trail is the Cribs, also known as Uncle
Harvey's Mausoleum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are conflicting stories on just what the cribs are,
ranging from a prohibition era bootleg casino and storage to a
fishing dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official story is that is the remains of a commercial
enterprise gone bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, not nearly as romantic as the prohibition stories is
still quite interesting. Built in 1919 as a sand and gravel hopper
by an enterprising man named Whitney. In 1919 the Lake Superior
area was a hotbed of activity and Whitney didn't like the
congestion of the harbor area especially in the busy summer months.
So this contraption was built. It was abandoned in 1922.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a plaque at the site and it reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the ruins of an energetic but short-lived commercial
enterprise by Whitney Brothers of Superior, Wisconsin. It was
Harvey Whitney&amp;rsquo;s brain-child. The world will now know the
true story &amp;ndash; an unromantic but intriguing one for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure was a sand and gravel hopper, built in the winter
of 1919 and abandoned in 1922. It was a frantic era of Duluth
construction in 1919 and Harvey was looking for efficiencies for
his sand and gravel operation. He didn&amp;rsquo;t like the canal
congestion, especially in the heavy summer months. He took a chance
that the city would revive efforts to rebuild the Outer Harbor
Breakwater which had been abandoned in 1872.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fancy idea. Sand from the lake around the Apostle
Island and gravel from Grand Marais were hauled to Duluth on the
scow, LIMIT, using the steam tug William A. Whitney. The LIMIT was
tied to the concrete foundation structure and unloaded to the steel
hopper with two steam powered clam shells. A large conveyor belt on
a trestle carried the materials to shore where they were dropped on
top of a tunnel into which trucks would maneuver for loading. This
tunnel is where the casino activity is said to have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Harvey Whitney guessed wrong on the breakwater. For 66
years now the primary use of the cribs has been by scuba divers and
nesting ducks. The greatest of the Great Lakes was just too
powerful &amp;ndash; just too unpredictable. He tried to deal with
Superior on its terms &amp;ndash; and lost. Thus, his family named it
&amp;ldquo;Uncle Harvey&amp;rsquo;s Mausoleum&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I spent a lot of time here when I was a kid and always ride my bike by here all the time. there always seems to be duck and geese and watch out for all the geese poop on the path. Enjoy your time here. Has benches for you to sit and enjoy the evening that were added not so long ago near the cache as well. There was a house here for a long time too but got tore down and turned into another pond for the ducks to go. Cache is on the way to my elementary school so be sure little reid always has lunch money so if you take some change leave some change. Thanks</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Enjoy a beautiful view from the Duluth Hillside. There is room to
pull your car off of the main road if you are driving. The pulloff
is easy; the hill itself is a bit steep. This is a very public area
with a fair amount of traffic, so some stealth will be required.
However, it is not out of the ordinary to see people hiking through
this undeveloped corner.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located off of scenic &lt;a href=
"http://www.amitycreek.com/sevenbridges/skyline1.html"&gt;Skyline
Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. There are many places along Skyline to pull off and
admire Duluth's beauty, and this spot will afford you a nice view
of the &lt;a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Hillside_%28Duluth%29"&gt;East
Hillside&lt;/a&gt; Neighborhood.
&lt;p&gt;The East Hillside neighborhood is a working class neighborhood
prized by its residents for its affordable housing, closeness to
jobs, and convenient transit service. The bulk of the area is
residential in nature, however it also has a business district, and
a medical district, which are shared with the neighboring Central
Hillside Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this location, not only will you enjoy a beautiful view of
Lake Superior and the &lt;a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_Lift_Bridge"&gt;Aerial Lift
Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, but on top of the hills you'll spot the iconic
Coppertop Church along with the soon to be closed Duluth Central
High School. If the wind is blowing the right direction, you may
hear the chimes from the &lt;a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Central_High_School_%28Duluth%29"&gt;
Old Central&lt;/a&gt; clock tower located downtown. Directly below
through all of the trees you'll see the &lt;a href=
"http://www.peaceucc.org/about/belltower.htm"&gt;bell tower&lt;/a&gt; for
Peace Church. Neighboring the church is the Grant Recreation area
and the soon to be remodeled Grant/Nettleton Elementary School.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Cache located next to a baseball field in Robbinsdale. Please be aware of when baseball games and please be extra stealthy because when I was hiding the container it is a little more exposed than what I would like it to be so put back as you found it. Looking for a old covered spice container. Enjoy your hunt and remember to SHAKE AND BAKE. Feel free to take pictures if you get your groove on.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is rehide number 6 so when you approach GZ don't be surprised if this cache is moving trying to get its groove on. It has been moving a lot lately but I have finally found a home for this one after a previous hider said he wouldn't replace his cache. But lets keep this one up and running so it can always be dancing. But the cache back be sure to put it back as you found it so it doesn't keep on movin. 

 But remember to always DO THE SHAKE AND BAKE WHEN YOU FIND THIS HIP HOP CACHE before continuing on with your festivities the rest of the day
     Original contents include: baseball die, courage pin, and a plastic dinosaur. plus 9 cents. Please if you take some coins please leave some so there is always change in the cache. Thanks [:D]

Please hide it back as you find it to ensure it doesn't get muggled too soon- I suspect the cache itself will be findable for us cachers but should be tough for a muggle to happen upon.  There is plenty of parking and this one should be winter friendly as well as "business casual friendly".  There is a pencil, the log and room for little else- but I'm sure someone will find a way to leave some swag. Enjoy!</groundspeak:short_description>

Call a friend that you haven't been in touch with for a while for

But, when you are home early, and there's a new cache only 4 blocks from home, you just can't help but run for it. I nice quick (but hot) bike ride over and there was the clean log. I had been checking in on the old one here, meaning to place a new one once it was archived, but I wasn't quick enough.

Signed the log, though for some reason my pen, which wrote fine on my hand, didn't write very well on the paper. I'll have to stop over and re-sign with a clearer writing utensil.

&lt;p&gt;Minnesota was largely covered by glaciers many times during the
last million years. The ice flowed across the state from both the
northeast and the northwest. As it advanced along separate paths,
it scraped up, crushed, and carried with it thousands of cubic
kilometers of rock debris, called glacial drift. This was deposited
in a thick layer over much of the state. About 25,000 years ago, a
tongue-shaped lobe of ice called the Superior lobe advanced across
Minnesota from the northeast. This ice eroded the mostly igneous
bedrock in Ontario and the Lake Superior region and deposited a
reddish, sandy, and rocky drift. Soils that developed from this
drift are not the most fertile. More recently another lobe of ice
advanced across Minnesota from the northwest. This was named the
Des Moines lobe because its point of farthest advance was Des
Moines, Iowa. Drift deposited by this ice contains crushed pieces
of sedimentary marine shales and limestones eroded from the
Winnipeg Lowland in souther Manitoba. Soils developed from this
drift are typically gray to brown, full of clay, and rich in lime,
magnesia, and potash. These soils are quite fertile and good for
agriculture. In the Elk River region, deposits from both the
northeast and the northwest occur in close proximity. Most of the
quite fertile material at the surface was deposited by an eastern
offshoot of the Des Moines lobe called the Grantsburg sublobe. The
older Superior lobe deposits are closer to the surface, however,
and may be mixed with those above. Thus, the fertility of the soils
in the Elk River region will vary depending on the proportionate
mix of the two parent drifts. River terrace deposits of sand and
gravel are also common near Elk River. The Mississippi River
established its present course during the final decline of the
glaciers. Water from the melting ice followed a number of different
routes until finally cutting the valley in which the river now
flows. Sand terraces mark former river courses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A duck waddles into a bar and hops on a stool. The bartender snarls, "What'll you have?"

     The bartender spits and says "We don't have grapes here, we serve drinks, now get out!"

     The duck hops off the stool and waddles out.

     The next day, the same duck waddles into the same bar, hops on a stool, looks the bartender in the eye and asks, "Got any grapes?"

     The bartender, irritated, says, "I told you yesterday we don't serve grapes here, we serve drinks, now GET OUT!"



     The duck hops off the stool and waddles out.

     The next day, the same duck waddles into the same bar and hops on a stool, looks at the bartender, and asks, "Got any grapes?"

     The bartender, infuriated, pounds his fist on the bar and yells at the duck, "I told you two times we don't serve grapes here, we serve drinks! If you ask me that ONE
     MORE TIME I'm going to nail your beak to the bar! NOW GET OUT!"

     With that, the duck shrugged, hopped off the stool and waddled out.

     The next day, the same duck waddled into the same bar, hopped on a stool, looked the bartender in the eye and asked, "Got any nails?"

     The bartender, puzzled, said no.

     The duck then looked him square in the eye and said, "Got any grapes?"

An easy puzzle for everyone! Are you geocacher enough to vanquish
the mighthy X-Men? Don't let their super powers defeat you. Use the
following images to figure out the cache's final location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Happy hunting! Also, there is a secret letter written at the top of
the log. I'm not sure if I'm going to do anything with it, but you
might want to write it down just in case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please replace the cache as found with appropriate camo. Beware of
muggles, trains, and Wolverine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congrats to sparkyfry on the FTF! Nice work!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

We've all had misadventures while we were caching.If you want, please tell one of those stories or make up a tall tale if you'd like while you're logging your find or DNF. Thanks.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I'll start. This summer I was after a cache in Sochacki park in Robbinsdale and I was determined to find it no matter where I had to reach into or under. Not only didn't I find it, but I ended up with the worst case of poison ivy I've ever had. This was not a tall tale! I'm still itching!  Now it's your turn. Tell one of your best stories, you know the ones we tell other cachers, or just make up a fun story about geocaching.

Don't come at it from the highway. Come through the park. There is a park nearby with legal parking. Obey park hours! Now come on! I'm waiting to hear your story!

Come on! I bet you've got a bunch of them.    Now come and get the cache and start a new adventure!

After a long night of single-parenting (my wife works evenings) and a failed attempt at the night cache "Night Reflections" with the 4 year old (WestSideDrew) and the 5 month old lab puppy (Cache the treasure dog) my wife returned from work and I decided to take the pup for another walk before bedtime. It's dark out but its a quiet neighborhood and with the construction there's not a lot of cars. So we start walking down towards one of the parks, a nice 1 mile round trip. After doing our business (and promptly cleaning it up) my blackberry beeps so I check my new email. Something from the great silver one, a new cache. Click the link and see it's from Mike, probably somewhere nearby. Grab the gpx file and import it into CacheSense, click on the compass and "HOLY SMOKES"!!!! We're practically standing in GZ right now. Sometime FTF are luck, but this one almost seemed like destiny.

But if it's a good DNF story, here's the preface to tonight find at Night Reflections:

Well it was an adventure. WestSideDrew (4 years old) and I were sitting around watching Star Wars and I ran across this night cache. I said "Well buddy, what do you say, should we give it a try?" "Sure daddy, plus lets bring Cache (the 5 month old lab puppy)."

So off to the trail, flash lights in hand.

"There's one" I say
"There's another one" says Andrew
and another and another
"Daddy I'm getting tired"
"Ruff ruff rufff" (translates as ducks... water... sticks... running)
"Where is the next one... oh there it is"
"Can you carry me"
"Where's the car"
"Are we lost"

"Let's go home and I'll come back again on my own next time."

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thought I would add another good caching story. My cache "What's the score stud' was recently archived because the structure it was hidden in (the old scoreboard near the local little league fields) was torn down. I happened to be over in the area again tonight and on the other side of the fields I happened to see a pile of weathered old timber and boards. I immediately recognized the wood as the old score board. A little poking around in the pile and all of a sudden I see that one piece of lumber that doesn't match the rest. Bingo, there's the old cache, still in its camo, log intact. What a surprise.Ready to find a new home.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">@6:35 STF I guess, for the re-hide.

As a matter of fact, I stopped to look for the original cache the day it had been removed. Hunted all over, couldn't figure out why I couldn't find it. Found a great hole to hide a cache in. Got to the office and went to log my DNF and tada found out it had been archived that day.

I was a little confused when I stopped by this morning because, like I Spy, I saw the old log, but new it was a redo and not a re-activated.

Either way, nice camo, took me a second to figure it out.

TFTC.

Or do geocachers try to get their families to eat lots of peanut butter so they can use the jars? If you have an opinion, or a different answer, I'd be glad to add it to my research.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is located in Theodore park in (guess what!) a peanut butter jar. Better get there before the squirrels smell the jar! PLEASE re-hide as good or better than you found it. There is a small stuffed animal and some assorted trading items.  This can be a very popular place, so if there is someone right next to the cache please come back later.
Good Luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

Tftc wish I had my good camera with me the fog over the lake and the ducks on the water were quite lovely.

After dropping her off at home WestSideDrew and I headed over to look for the new 4 hides. After bombing out on the first 2, this was an easy find. The only problem was as soon as we got the log signed, a police officer pulled up 50 feet away and sat there for a while (maybe even checking us out). Finally after pretending to call my wife and ask which side of the building she was on (in a louder than needed voice), we re-hid and headed off. (D6)</groundspeak:text>

Got to the GZ and saw some light flashing around. Who could it be, 3humphs, talkinghands, bpfinder... nope none other than SharkNoseBunny. I let me coordinates settle in and started to poke around. What was the clue again?? There it was. Nice hide.

After chatting for a bit and getting tempted to go look for a few others that just came out, I decided I had better take the simple choice and call it a night.

TFTC!!

"Marker Felt" size="+2" color="purple"&gt;Ted is a great guy who isn't
splashy, but he has a nice collection of hides (although stalking
him is tough due to a Jamaican hide) and has quietly arrived at
1,000 finds! I know we all enjoy seeing him at caches and chatting
about different hides - he's always up for the challenge!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
girlbadluck said it best:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ted the Man is a quiet guy.&lt;br /&gt;
You don't know he's around until he walks by.&lt;br /&gt;
His work related skills make him a great "go to" man.&lt;br /&gt;
But his caching skills can't be beat by anyone in the land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you meet Ted you may wonder - wow, what a man!&lt;br /&gt;
Ted is quite the geocacher - he can always find the can!&lt;br /&gt;
Text pictures are sent when he hides my "Bigfoot" toy.&lt;br /&gt;
My job is to hunt the office to find and uncover his ploy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

width="360" height="360" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't get him started about those Vikes.&lt;br /&gt;
He will tell you that Green Bay is a sham. Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;
When you think of friends, one comes to mind.&lt;br /&gt;
Ted, a great guy and a great friend of mine!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and join the party as tonkaMN finds his silver can and
signs in as FTF.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

She wrote prolifically, but was largely unknown until after her death, when her sister Lavinia discovered her trove of poems.  She was first published in 1890.  She explored the themes of death and immortality in many of her poems, of which "Because I could not stop for death" is one.</groundspeak:short_description>

they will NOT be thinking of snow, but this cache was submitted for
publication on 11/13/10, the date of the first snowfall for the
winter of 2010-2011.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t hold it against cachers who take off
the winter months in Minnesota, but I love caching when the snow
flies and the temperature drops. Caching gives me the motivation to
get outside for some quality recreation and exercise at a time of
year when the alternative is a Treadmill watching TV, or far worse
sitting on the couch watching the Vikings &lt;img src=

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect time of the year to go caching.
Beautiful Scenery! No Muggles! No bugs! No weeds! So get out and
embrace the season &amp;hellip; besides, what else you going to do for
the next 5 months? &lt;img src=

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="3&amp;quot;"&gt;It's after the holidays and you just can't
seem to figure out what to do with that gift that Aunt Elsie or
Uncle Gottfried gave you.&lt;br /&gt;
It doesn't fit anyone, it's a horrid color, doesn't go with your
decor, you already have 3 of them, or Aunt Elsie got your boys
mixed up with your cousins family of girls. And just where did they
find it anyway???&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What to do, what to do with that doo-dad.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, wrap it up all pretty like and bring it along for our white
elephant gift exchange. Pass that lovely treasure on to someone
else to enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#B40404"&gt;Slap a bow on your gift and if yours is voted
the ugliest bow you win a prize!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't have a white elephant sitting at your house. No problem! Come
along and enjoy the fun and meet other cachers and see what new
treasure they'll be taking home!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy a cup of joe and share tall tales about your winter caching
adventures and get warmed up before going out and trudging through
the snow looking for those outdoor treasures we all seem to enjoy
searching for or if you're one of the unlucky ones...head to work.
Come and enjoy a warm cup and some after the holidays
warmth!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, after a short drive (13 miles @ 27 minutes according to google) to which I allowed 45 minutes, and took an hour and a half, I arrived and despite all my growling at the drive, was very glad I went. Saw some old faces, met some new ones and had a really nice time. Wish I had known about the FTF swag, I would have left at 6:30 this morning to get there first ;)

Thanks for a great event.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Two paths diverged near a crusty wood,
And sorry I could not wander both
And be one cacher, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better coords,
Because it was shoveled and clear;
Though as for that the muggles there
Had worn them really about the same (or none at all),
And both that morning equally lay (but morning will do you no good)
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day (or night)!
Yet knowing good coords leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever double back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh, or in my log
Sometime later today or tomorrow hence:
Two paths diverged in a wood, and I-
I took the one less traveled by,
in order to find the cache
And that has made all the difference.


This cache is only available at night so bring a reliable light source and clear vision. Many eyes will help. Once you've arrived at GZ look around for one reflective beacon. Once you've spotted which way to travel, your search will not take long though deep snow may slow your progress. Each subsequent reflective beacon should be visible from the previous one. Your goal is to spot a final 'set' of three reflectors. These three mark the final location. A set of three like-sized trees guard a cache which has a very low muggle factor but will likely be covered with snow for 8 months of each year. Reflective beacons will vary from three feet off the ground to six feet up and the color of the reflector does not matter. Because this is a night time cache, you will likely have many parking options.

Note: there is a special leather keepsake for the FTF and a nice geocoin for the trading.

Thanks matildamay for the help.

Congratulations to Sharknose Bunnies, Seeingitdifferent, and 3humps on the quick FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

On the way home with WestSideDrew and decided to stop and grab this one. I totally missed it when it was published (despite running into 3humphs the night he was going to hide it).

We made sure to walk around in a lot of circles to our tracks weren't easy to follow (ok we didn't find it right away).

After signing the log, we heard a terrible high pitched squeal followed by a "Whooo Whooo". WSDrew informed me that was an owl catching a mouse. We sat in the woods and listened to the owl for a while before heading back to the car.

Before we even got back to the trail, we met a beautiful whitetail deer (20 feet away). Everyone was being calm and quiet so we watched it as it slowly walked past and went about its business.

What a great spot especially in the winter. Glad be stopped. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;Cooler Crew Cachers&lt;/b&gt; feel strongly that winters are here to
stay in Minnesota. We feel that the citizens of Mounds View and
neighboring communities should take advantage of this situation by
participating in the winter activities that are available in our
communities. Rather than hide from winter, people should go out and
have fun in it. We encourage everyone to live by the &lt;b&gt;Cooler Crew
Cachers credo:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Broadway Pizza Maple Grove - Club Car Room
8069 Wedgewood Lane N
Maple Grove, MN</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Join us for the first annual Fantasy Football Awards Banquet. We will crown the champion of year 3 of this exciting league! Prizes will be awarded to the top and bottom finishers (we will award the prize to the lowest finisher present cause that prize is something that should be coveted in person) If I find some other random stuff heck we'll hand that out too.

This event is open to ANY and ALL cachers that are looking for an excuse to get out of the house and meet up with other cachers.  If you haven't found many caches in the Maple Grove area there are several close by that are findable at night, so cache early, cache late, just join in for a fun time and some pizza. 

Please try to mark a will attend so we can get an idea of what kind of angry mob to expect.

**The Fantasy Football League is not endorsed by, sanctioned or controlled by the Minnesota Geocaching Association. It is merely made up of cachers who enjoy trash talking over football games.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is intended to mark the location of and share information about Saint Joseph's.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Thank you very much to mnfishnutz for the location idea!

The church was organized in 1856. A log church was built in 1858 and called St. Francis. The current structure was built in 1877 for $2,600 and was named St. Joseph's for the patron saint of the donor. St. Joe's Little Church,as it sometimes called, is the burial site of Anthony LeCounte. He is considered to be the earliest settler to build a log cabin in Plymouth, which was located on the east side of Medicine Lake.

This is my Girl Scout Gold Award Project (like an Eagle Scout Project). It is a Historical Tour of the City of Plymouth through Geocaches. Plymouthmnhistoricalsociety.com has more information on other historical sites in the city. Currently, it also has approximate GPS coordinates of other sites as well as information and pictures of them. In the future, more Geocaches will be added.
I hope you enjoy the cache and learn something too!

The contents of the cache include some small inexpensive trinkets and a log book and pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

Hustled WestSideDrew into the car (not an easy feat at the play land) and headed off to GZ. Get there and see a couple of shadows lurking in the area, worried that it might be the one-gloved-rodent-headed-croc-wearing winter homeless beast. But who di you suppose it was??? Sharknose Bunny and a new face (for us) seeingitdifferent. Nice to make up for the crazy bridge cache (still a little freaked out about nearly getting run over and frozen) and get my first FTF for the year. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

very long winter. Muggle has not pulled one of his schemes in many
months. While many cachers have been awaiting spring, Muggle has
not stopped. He and his evil Muggle henchmen have intentionally

complaint and for that, we are extremely proud of them. When we
placed this cache the terra was firma and held about 2+ feet of
snow. Not so this night. Just take a look at two of the
participants who I will not name here. I won't even blur their
faces because their looks convey no shame. Way to go all of you who
made it to this one!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Taming of the Shrew was written by William Shakespeare. Little
know fact, however, is that William had a younger brother by the
name of Mike Shakespeare. Mike wasn't the most creative play
writer, so when he decided to write his first play the taming of
the screw was born. Mike Shakespeare was also way ahead of his time
and found a way to geocache back in the 1500s. He commonly got on
his brother's nerves when he would hide his collar and tell him he
had to "geocache" to find it. Here is a picture of Mike
Shakespeare...&lt;br /&gt;

finding. This cache was inspired by a cache we found about a
year&lt;br /&gt;
ago which we enjoyed and we can now just replicate it. There
was&lt;br /&gt;
only room for a log book so BYOP. After finding, please put&lt;br /&gt;

That sucker was tough to get out. Between freezing fingers and a little ice it took longer to extract than it should have. But finally got the cache and signed it and returned a little more gingerly that previously so hopefully it won't be so hard for the next finder.

Thanks for the puzzle and cache.</groundspeak:text>

I am at these places alllllll the time and I thought it might be fun for others too.  stealth may be necessary. container is a little bigger than a micro, but not as big as a small. there is room for a log book and could hold small items/ trackables.  BYOP.  and thanks for caching!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">***UPDATE***
Ok, this cache has been approved for placement by the store management under the requirement that the store name is not used in any way.  Therefore the name change. Still the same cache though.  I cannot stress enough that stealth is required since there are many paranoid people out there who know nothing of our game.  The store also requested that cachers do not get in the way of normal business traffic.   However, if you need something there, I encourage you to get your shopping done.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p align="center"&gt;Thanks, Mike for bringing breakfast! Thank you
all who joined in the FTF party: sparkyfry, 3Humphs, LabguyMN,
WestSideDaddy, cubswon, Sharknose Bunnies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;span id=
"ctl00_ContentBody_LongDescription"&gt;Congratulations on finding
1,000 caches, Mike!&amp;nbsp;I've had the pleasure of getting to know
you through emails and we've attended a few events together -
haven't had the pleasure of caching together yet but maybe someday
we'll meet on the trail?&amp;nbsp; You are always smiling (and so is
your wife!) when I see you at events.&amp;nbsp;And you seem to be
having the time of your life finding plastic containers out in the
woods.&amp;nbsp;Glad to see that you are getting closer (everyday!) to
the end of your geocaching streak - it has been a tough winter to
tackle this challenge but spring is coming so I know that you will
make it!&amp;nbsp; And we have enjoyed your great hides and look
forward to many more!!&amp;nbsp; - Quilting is fun too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I've only met Mike a few times, but every time has
been a positive experience. I've enjoyed finding his caches; you
can tell he puts a lot of care into them, rather than just slapping
a nano on a signpost (like I usually do with my hides). He's
currently on a consecutive days caching streak of over 200. I'm
about a week behind him. Hopefully, we'll both make it to a year
and can have a celebratory event. Oh, and of course, he's got the
required first name to be a male cacher in the 763 area code. See
you on the trails, Mike! - sparkyfry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Congratulations, Mike Deotis, on 1,000 finds! Mike
is a cacher who adds so much to geocaching. His hides are always
thoughtfully placed, he takes responsibility for his actions, and
he is a very sincere and trustworthy person. I think one mark of a
geocacher is the care they put into their logs, and Mike always
takes the time to say something complimentary and original about a
cache. I always enjoy reading his logs, and it's been fun watching
him cross the 200-cache mark in his consecutive days streak. Here's
hoping you'll be able to make it the rest of the way, but whatever
you do, I'm sure you'll have fun and do it with class! Good luck on
the next thousand! - Sharknose Bunnies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Congratulations, Mike, on reaching the milestone of
1000 finds!&amp;nbsp; I look forward to seeing you on the caching
trails as you move toward your next milestone!&amp;nbsp;- gpcat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;My family and I met Mike on the Southeast side of
Crystal Lake in Robbinsdale last June. Where he was nice enough to
come out and play "Your getting warmer" with us. Not only did he
help us with that cache, he's helped us other's besides. I have a
couple of FTF's from his caches too. Like the day I was doing my
custodian job at the church, one of his cache's popped up, less
than a mile away. Heck yeah, I'll grab that. I just wish I had
missed the doggie doo on the way out. How he got into that park
unscathed is beyond me. If you've ever read one of Mike's log's, or
gotten to know him, you'll be wondering the same things. How did he
get out alive? Why is he playing a live action game of "Chicken"
with two Semi's? Did he really see&amp;nbsp;A seven foot tall fur
covered swamp frog or someone that just has high tech snow
shoes&amp;nbsp;How much closer could he have parked? Did he find a
cache to keep his streak alive? What other new adventure has
befallen him today? So our hats are off to a great guy. Hope the
next 1000 are just as much fun as the first 1000! - 3Humphs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Congratulations, Mike! - WestSideDaddy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;We first met Mike when we were checking one of our
caches. From afar he had that geocaching-look about him, you know,
a little bit suspicious standing in a wooded area where others
seldom tread. Seems he was checking the cache too. Since then we've
met up with him on the trail, have enjoyed seeking his caches on
FTF quests and have had the pleasure of caching with his wife and
him on a couple occasions. He's a great guy and always fun to talk
with and be with. His stories and logs are as good as they get.
Thanks for your friendship and the impetus to eat more
peanutbutter. Congrats on your milestone!- Brooklyn51&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">There used to be a small run down shopping center in this area, but the city took over the land and leveled it. There were plans for the land, but then the economy went south, so it's been empty for a few years. Let me know if you remember it too. Or just pick up an easy cache. There is parking across the street.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">See if you remember any of the stores that were in the shopping center. I'll go first. There used to be a "typewriter" repair store right next to the center on Bass Lake Rd. I guess we don't use many of those any more, huh? Now your turn. See how many you can bring back to life. I'm waiting!

&lt;p&gt;No special occasion, just an abundance of newly found free time
and a visit back home for Birdin'. Let's all gather for a cup of
joe....or tea....or cocoa...and lots of storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;
This neighborhood's changed a lot in 40 years, but State of Bean
looks like a great place to gather for a little while, so hope to
see some old friends and new over a cuppa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing formal about this event. Just drop in and grab a chair,
swap trackables and tales and enjoy the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This Geocache is part of a series of caches about the history of Plymouth. 
This cache is intended to mark the location of and share information about the Mt. Olivet Chapel and District 51 School.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Thank you to mnfishnutz and Troutonthebrain for help with the location and cache!

Organized in 1854 as the German Evangelical Lutheran Church, the church first met in the Herman Sandhoff home. The church was built in 1880 on land donated by the Sandhoff family (now Mt. Olivet Chapel) and called the "Immanuel Evangelical Church of the Evangelical and Reformed Church of North America." Worship services were conducted in German until the early 1900’s. It was completely restored in 1998 as the Mt Olivet Chapel.
Christoph was the first person buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery on April 2, 1871.  Other early members of Mount Olivet such as the Sandhoff, Schmidt, Roggerman, and Hoppenrath families are buried there.


The District 51 School was located across the street from the Mt. Olivet Chapel and was the first school in Plymouth. It was built as a shanty in 1856, then a log schoolhouse in 1859. It was turned into a house and then later it burned. District 51 consolidated with the Robbinsdale School District in the mid 1950’s.

This is my Girl Scout Gold Award Project (like an Eagle Scout Project). It is a Historical Tour of the City of Plymouth through Geocaches. Plymouthmnhistoricalsociety.com has more information on other historical sites in the city. Currently, it also has approximate GPS coordinates of other sites as well as information and pictures of them. In the future, more Geocaches will be added.
I hope you enjoy the cache and learn something too!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Amelia Mary Earhart (born July 24, 1897; missing July 2, 1937; declared legally dead January 5, 1939) was a noted American aviation pioneer and author. Earhart was the first woman to receive the U.S. Distinguished Flying Cross, awarded for becoming the first aviatrix to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She set many other records, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots. Earhart joined the faculty of the world-famous Purdue University aviation department in 1935 as a visiting faculty member to counsel women on careers and help inspire others with her love for aviation. She was also a member of the National Woman's Party, and an early supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment.

During an attempt to make a circumnavigational flight of the globe in 1937 in a Purdue-funded Lockheed Model 10 Electra, Earhart disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island. Fascination with her life, career and disappearance continues to this day.

While memorializing the rural landscape, vernacular, culture and people of New England in his traditional verse style, his poems also transcend the boundaries of time and place with metaphysical significance and modern exploration of human nature in all her beauty and contradictions. Though not without his critics, millions of readers the world over have found comfort and profound meaning in his poetry and he has influenced numerous other authors, poets, musicians, and playwrights into the 21st Century.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor, scientist, and businessman who developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park" (now Edison, New Jersey) by a newspaper reporter, he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large teamwork to the process of invention, and therefore is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.

Edison is the third most prolific inventor in history, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. He is credited with numerous inventions that contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison originated the concept and implementation of electric-power generation and distribution to homes, businesses, and factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Manhattan Island, New York.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color="red"&gt;I first met 3humphs and family last summer over
at Crystal Lake. He had asked for a hint to a cache there. After
doing hot and cold and finding the cache, we sat down to swap
stories. Before I knew it, an hour had gone by. The 3humphs family
is just fun to be with. The male part of 3humphs is also great at
hiding caches. He's the only one I know to make a dog poop cache.
He's always glad to help with a hint when I can't find cache.
Thanks for being apart of our caching neighborhood!!&lt;/font&gt;
-mikedeotis ------------------ &lt;font color="orange"&gt;Whether it's a
challenging new cache or as a member of the FTF party, you can
always count on Mark. I first became aware of Mark when I started
caching and kept finding all these little metal camels in the
caches I was finding. It wasn't until later that I had a chance to
meet the infamous 3humphs (I think it was him climbing a tree).
Congratulations on making a big milestone and I'm sure we'll
continue to see you out on the trail.&lt;/font&gt; -WestSideDaddy (Chris)
---------------Congratulations on finding 1000 caches Mark! I know
there will be many more to come. I had the pleasure of meeting Mark
some time back during a lunch-time caching foray with Valsey. His
exuberance was, and still is, very infectious. We all went on to
have many more lunch-time cache runs after that first meeting. Fun
times for sure. One very memorable outing was after we all attended
the 2011 Puzzle Event in Monticello and went on to try to find
&amp;ldquo;Waterlogged&amp;rdquo;, GC1VM17. There were a bunch of us and I
know we were all having a good time. Mark was really into it and it
was clear he was having fun. I was impressed that he took it upon
himself to have t-shirts made to commemorate the big DNF
&amp;ldquo;event&amp;rdquo;. I consider him a very good cacher and as such
I&amp;rsquo;m positive he will soon get to the 5K milestone. I hope
I&amp;rsquo;m there to see it. Mike (Fish2007)-------------------
&lt;font color="green"&gt;3humphs, Congrats on finding your 1000 cache!
Since I have met you; it seems that you are becoming a charismatic
leader of geocaching. Who else has led a group of cachers who in
all regards were probably comfortably content and warm onto a cold
frozen lake in hopes of finding a &amp;ldquo;Waterlogged&amp;rdquo; cache
beneath the ice? What an epic cache search that was. It is obvious
that you have a willingness to help others to succeed whether by
helping solve a tough puzzle, climbing a tall tree, or making an
elusive find. It is always a great time caching with you,
exchanging caching stories and laughs. Congrats again and will be
looking forward to your 2000th find.&lt;/font&gt;
-Valsey--------------------- &lt;font color="blue"&gt;We met 3humphs, one
humph at a time. We first met the youngest Humph on an FTF quest in
Crystal. She had run up ahead of the second Humph who was being
remotely guided to GZ by yet a third Humph. We finally met the
third Humph at an event. Since that time we have met up at other
events and on the trail. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see a family enjoying
the same outdoor activity and it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to talk to
them. We&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate enough to capture one of
their cute little signature camel tokens. Congratulations on your
milestone with many more to come. Have a great summer of
caching&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;ll watch for you! &amp;ndash;&lt;/font&gt; Brooklyn51
(Donald and Denise)--------------------- What can I say about
3humphs.... I've only found a few of his hides so far, but I know
him best as the Master Augerer during the largest DNF party I've
ever attended. His enthusiasm knows no bounds, and his sense of
humor lightens any event.- Spstanley
----------------------&lt;font color="red"&gt;3humphs has a knack for
beating me on FTF runs all over the north metro- that's kinda how
we met! Our first encounter though was in his log for my first
hide- GC27GTX -"So he say's 'no I went to a community college!" it
was my first hide and his first FTF. Since then it has been a PAF
here, a puzzle there, and many a failed FTF run (for me). His
attitude is contageous and he's an all around good dude. Congrats
on your 1000th- which I'm sure you'll arrive at just ahead of
me...&lt;/font&gt; LabguyMN (AKA Matt)
-----------------------&lt;font color="orange"&gt;3humphs is the most
persistent cacher I've ever met. The first time I met him, we were
looking for a cache on an island that had been DNF'ed multiple
times and was pretty clearly no longer there. He wanted the smiley
so bad that he loaded up his family and canoe to look for it a
third time. Sure enough, it still wasn't there. It's no surprise
that finding a cache every day for over 300 days is a piece of cake
for him. Anyway, congrats on 1,000, 3humphs, and here's to your
next 1,000!&lt;/font&gt; - sparkyfry-----------------------------
Congrats 3humphs on hitting 1,000! The first time I ran into
3humphs was while I was chasing a FTF. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to know
3humphs through phone, e-mail and best of all through geocaching
with him a couple of times. He is a very enthusiastic cacher that
likes to have fun! He even helped me organize the largest DNF party
I have ever attended, shirts and all! Here is to a great caching
family and to your next 1,000.- SID---------------- &lt;a href=

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geocaching?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are new to
caching and need help let us know. We want to help you enjoy the
game as much as we do. This will be a great opportunity for you to
ask questions about geocaching, the MnGCA, Groundspeak, GPSr's and
more. If we don't have the answer to your question, we probably
know who does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

you how the game is played.&lt;br /&gt;

I also enjoyed trying to kill myself rolling down the hill to get back before the meeting started (that failed). Really withed I had one a Kubb, but I really like the walking stick (yeah axman) and coin. Looking forward to getting back up to duluth and to more events this summer and fall.

is at posted location *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge is all about finding who your local cache hiders
are. In order to log this challenge you must find 30 caches. Pretty
easy, right? Here are the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find 3 different types of caches hidden by 10 different
cachers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All cache types are acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;All caches must be found after the
placing of this cache 3/20/2011&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When posting your found it note, please include the names of
the 10 cache hiders and the types of their finds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cache can't be used in your count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual cache is a small PB container with room for some
trade items or travel bugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a brand new bison tube and a silver dollar for FTF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSAK Users: If you use GSAK, you can use this macro to check
your find if you qualify. &lt;a href=
"http://gsak.net/board/index.php?showtopic=13226" target=
"_BLANK"&gt;Local Cacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A son of St. Paul, Minnesota, Fitzgerald grew up in a modest home on Summit Avenue, close to the mansions of James J. Hill and others. The excesses of the 1920s and the relentless pursuit of the American Dream is best exemplified in "The Great Gatsby," which is still one of the most-read books in American high schools.

This park and grab cache, hidden on the southeast side of Jorissen Road,  is located on public land owned by the City of Minnetonka.

The land on the northwest side of the road is privately owned.  Across the wetland to the northwest you'll spy the Three Rivers Parks Regional Trail.

You'll enjoy a surprisingly quiet experience here!</groundspeak:long_description>

I dropped 2 TB but forgot to grab any, so I guess my TB karma is low, I'll have to make up for it next time.

EVERYONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wow, another unbelievable Puzzle Event! The final count is
&lt;b&gt;317&lt;/b&gt; attendees signed on the logsheets, I'm completely
floored by the turnout today. I had a blast, and am thrilled that
so many cachers said they did too!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Huge thanks again to all of the puzzle creators and donators, you
are the true stars of today's event. Without you, there's no reason
to do this!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Special thanks to everyone who organized, stressed out, donated
cash and door prizes, and otherwise contributed to today's success.
We had too many to name individually, including those that pitched
in today to quick staple packets and get everything organized
before the doors opened, but I especially want to thank
&lt;b&gt;choromanskilynn, Maryufaust, mnfishnutz, Quilting is fun too,
Tonkajen, Troutonthebrain, wdtj&lt;/b&gt; and the staff at River City
Extreme for all of their superhuman, above-and-beyond efforts
today. Truly, we could not have done it without you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It only took 2.5 years to convince me to host this Event, we'll see
if King Boreas can talk me into it again! ;-) The original Event
details are unchanged below, for historical purposes. Thanks again
everyone, hope to see y'all again soon!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who's ready to celebrate National Puzzle Day 2011 in style?
Two-and-a-half years after the original &lt;a title=
"Visit the original Event!" href="http://coord.info/GC19PFF"
target="_new"&gt;Puzzle Event&lt;/a&gt;, it's high-time to have another one!
Who's in?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
Everyone is invited to an afternoon of food, fun, and fellowship in
Monticello. This Event will be held at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;River City Extreme&lt;br /&gt;
3875 School Blvd&lt;br /&gt;
Monticello, MN 55362&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Saturday, January 29th&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;11:30 a.m. to 2:00
p.m.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;* Door Prize drawings at 1:00 *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hors d'oeuvres platters will be served, but outside food is not
allowed onsite. Full meals can be ordered in advance, but no
purchase is required for attendance. Special thanks to Beth for
allowing us to gather at her location!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like the first event, the goal here is to generate interest in
puzzle caches and provide help to those who don't know how to get
started on them. Since many puzzles use similar tricks, once you
learn how to solve a few you'll be able to solve a whole bunch
more! A number of generous cache owners have donated solutions to
some of their puzzles. All attendees will receive a packet that
contains puzzle solutions and coordinates for the following list of
caches:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Twin Cities &amp;amp; Central Minnesota Puzzles:&lt;/b&gt;

Each packet will have strong hints or giveaways for each puzzle,
for those who want to work the puzzles out on their own. A sealed
envelope containing the final solved coordinates will also be
provided, to be used (or not) at each cacher's discretion. Huge
thanks again to the cache owners for their donations, I appreciate
it!&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The City of Brooklyn Center is the recipient of $2 million in federal stimulus funds for the Bass Lake Road (County Road 10) Streetscape and Regional Trail Project, announced by the Metropolitan Council in June 2009.  Extending along Bass Lake Road from Brooklyn Boulevard to Highway 100, this project will consist of many design aspects including:

    * Regional Trail Connection.  A missing segment of the regional trail system will be constructed, providing a central connection to existing regional trails.
    * Pedestrian Safety.  Design elements will encourage safe pedestrian routes and street crossings.
    * Water Quality. Biofiltration systems will enable treatment of roadway runoff that may be contaminated with chloride from de-icing efforts before it discharges into Shingle Creek.
    * Streetscaping. Multi-function aesthetic features will promote safety and beauty, including landscaping, pedestrian plaza and benches, lighting and colored concrete.  The look will be coordinated with Xerxes Avenue streetscaping to provide a consistent feel to the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache seem to be winter friendly.  The county Seems to plows almost to the end of the road so the last 100 ft you may have to walk.

There is a fallen tree on the road that you can drive around.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;This cache is part of a series intended to showcase
Wisconsin's Rustic Roads (WRR). Wisconsin's Legislature established
the Rustic Roads program in 1973 to preserve what remains of
Wisconsin's scenic, lightly traveled roads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches are usually hidden near the right-of-way so that no
bushwhacking is required. Please be respectful of private property
and be aware that, although traffic is normally light, there may be
no shoulder on which to park. Be sure to keep an especially close
eye on children while hunting for the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
County Highway E begins at its intersection with County A and runs
a total of 2.1 miles, providing some great views of Big McKenzie
Lake before ending near the Washburn County line at Tokash Road.
Located in Burnett County, WRR 80 has gentle hills as it winds
along and can provide good views of wildlife, especially loons and
bald eagles. Be aware of your speed, as the road is often used by
pedestrians and cyclists. We vacation nearby and ride on it every
day when we're here. Fall colors can be spectacular in this
area.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be looking for a piece of the former Horace Mann High
School . This was my school and I have fond memories of it, my two
sons attended it as well and I was glad we had that in common. The
building itself sat where the playground equipment is now at the
Middle School and was demolished in 2009. This cache is a tribute
to it and placed on the path to the New High School . Enjoy the
area,as change is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

two golden hours, each set with sixty diamond minutes. No reward is

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Rump Skinner Hill, a long time tradition in Spooner for sledding
during the long winter. Located near the new community walking
trail between the Spooner City park and the High School. Easy paved
trail most of the way. The hill is known for a steep and rocky
downhill sled ride. Slide at your own risk!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kids in Spooner have hiked back to Rump Skinner Hill for
generations. I remember it from my High School days, but didn't
know exactly how to get to it my self. After the baseball field was
built, access was much easier. Both of my sons brought their sleds
back here, 10 years ago and now it is easier than ever to locate.
The new community walking trail leads right to the area. Cache is a
good sized plastic jar, log book and pen. Plenty of room for small
trade items. This cache is winter friendly, so bring your toboggan.
&lt;p&gt;Suggested parking is at the City park on College Street. Thanks
for your interest in our Caches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Vol.7, The 70's.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The lyrics with an asterisk, are for those who were working on
this when it published,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But couldn't get it past the checker.&lt;br /&gt;
I was out caching with the Week Night Cachers and couldn't fix the
puzzle or the checker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Love is a lie made to make you blue.&lt;br /&gt;
so take it easy*&lt;br /&gt;
I'm making records, my fans they can't wait.***&lt;br /&gt;
You drive us wild we'll drive you crazy, but don't mess around with
your tricks.&lt;br /&gt;
When you believe in things you don't understand, try to understand,
try, try ,try to understand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm a tiger when I want love, but I'm a snake if we disagree.&lt;br /&gt;
Could we have kippers for breakfast Mummy dear, Mummy dear?&lt;br /&gt;
Gonna take a freight train, Down at the station.&lt;br /&gt;
The smell of death surrounds you. I'm okay alone, but you got
something I need.&lt;br /&gt;
I'm over my head, but it sure feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;
She said, You ain't seen nothing yet.*&lt;br /&gt;
I said, I know, Everybody funny, now you funny too.&lt;br /&gt;

one is correct.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">It's time to learn about the scintillating issue of suburban
stormwater management!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The posted coordinates will bring you to a plaque describing some
stormwater issues faced by Golden Valley and other suburbs. This
isn't an issue people think about that much, but think about it:
Every time a new street gets paved, a new house constructed, or a
new driveway built, these impervious surfaces create a barrier
preventing stormwater from flowing the way it would otherwise flow.
Even a swimming pool is considered an impervious surface, somewhat
counter-intuitively.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But why does this matter? There are several reasons. First,
out-of-control stormwater can make flood control challenging.
Additional runoff can erode watercourses (streams and rivers) as
well as cause flooding after the stormwater collection system is
overwhelmed by the additional flow. Second, a lot of surface water
-- especially water traveling over roadways -- carries various
contaminants that can pollute the water bodies that serve as
destinations for stormwater. With the demand for water exceeding
the availability of readily available water, stormwater is also a
potential resource. Techniques of stormwater harvesting with point
source water management and purification can potentially make urban
environments self sustaining in terms of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, stormwater is typically managed by a &lt;a href=
"http://www.mnwatershed.org/"&gt;watershed district&lt;/a&gt;, an obscure
unit of local government that crosses city and county lines. The
watershed district representing the area you're standing on was
created in 1969. The district includes portions of nine cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Earthcache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get credit for this earthcache, you must e-mail me the
answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which creek forms the watershed in which you are standing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Into which body of water does that creek flow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List two advantages of the native flowers and grasses planted
in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the website for the governmental body that oversees water
runoff for this area. (Hint: Google the name of the creek plus the
words "Watershed Management Commission.") Name the nine cities
comprising the commission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">LabguyMN will get his 1,234th cache very soon&lt;br /&gt;
He has claimed the FTF. But you can be the first to the STF.&lt;br /&gt;
Your looking for a Silver, Polka-Dogged Ammo Can.&lt;br /&gt;
And next time you see him ask him about his cool key fob.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color='teal' size='2'&gt;This one is for one of those Good Guy's
who deserves a bit more than your Standard Average Tribute
Cache.&lt;br /&gt;
LabguyMN is an impassioned Geocacher who is a Hull-o-va-lotta fun
to cache with.&lt;br /&gt;
I personally have enjoyed many adventures with him.&lt;br /&gt;
He even once saved me from an impending bear attack.&lt;br /&gt;
I was aiming for a really cool/hard tribute puzzle cache at his 1K
Milestone, But I couldn't put it together in time.&lt;br /&gt;
So I threw caution to the wind, bucked tradition, and am starting a
new 1,234 fad that I am sure will sweep the nation.&lt;br /&gt;
OR this will be the only one. Cheers to your next 1,234&lt;br /&gt;
Mark (3Humphs)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color='red' size='2'&gt;I first met Matt
(LabguyMN) on the hunt for Topsy Turvy (GC1C6YF) which was lonely.
The terrain was crazy dangerous due to slippery snow next to a
cliff. The sane among us were nearly resigned to not finding the
cache, but Matt broke out his Army Ranger skills and rope, tied
some kind of harness around his waist and happily plunged over the
cliff edge, making his way over to the GZ where he found the cache
in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color='red' size='2'&gt;&lt;font color=
'red' size='2'&gt;Later that same day, while finding some caches on
the other side of the river, I lost my car keys in 7" of fresh
snow. Both Sharknose Bunnies and Matt helped me look for a while,
but Sharknose had to leave. Matt shared his nice warm truck while
we waited the near-eternity for the locksmith to come. He offered
to drive me 20+ miles home and back to fetch my spare keys! How
often do you find people so generous with their time?&lt;br /&gt;
Since then I've been on a few different adventures with Matt, and
it's always a blast.&lt;br /&gt;
Here's to LabguyMN's next 1,234 finds!&lt;br /&gt;
Jim~JJ (JJnTJ)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color='maroon' size='2'&gt;I contacted LabguyMN because he beat
me to a Lonely cache in the SauliH History series and suggested we
work together on the rest. Come the morning of our get together, he
had rounded up a posse' of five other geocachers. He later referred
to it as the "Smiley H Tour". He had maps for all of us with the
coordinates for each cache listed in the order we would make our
finds. He also offered to drive and lent his boots to 3Humphs who
returned them, mud plus some extra. I think a 1,234 Tribute cache
is very appropriate for LabguyMN.&lt;br /&gt;
GoldRibbon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color='purple' size='2'&gt;LabguyMN Congrats on finding your
1,234th Geocache!!&lt;br /&gt;
What a great geocacher to have in the North-Metro or in MN in
general. LabguyMN lives less then a half a mile from me, but we
only met face to face at the 2010 Geocoinfest, 25 miles away from
our homes, After many months of emails and variouse PAFs, LabguyMN
will always help give you a little nudge in the correct direction.
I like LabguyMN's new policy of PAF or CO. If you have to PAF, you
should post a DNF for the cache page. After all without the PAF you
would DNF'ed the cache or likely spend a lot more time there.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is to finding your next 1,234 caches!!&lt;br /&gt;
Steve aka Iceman Winter&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color='black' size='2'&gt;When I think of
LabguyMN, I think of&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color='red' size='4'&gt;diabolical
genius&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color='black' size='2'&gt;puzzles. Many nights I
lay awake pondering the intricacies of the workings of his mind.
Countless productive hours at work lost trying to solve his puzzle
caches...if only the boss knew. Even with nudges in the right
direction from Matt himself, the answers still seem to elude us.
Once we ended up in the middle of Lake Superior! Seriously, he is a
great guy. Always willing to help a fellow cacher. Congratulations
on your unique milestone Matt!&lt;br /&gt;
Yellowdogs, John Borg&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color='yellow' size='3'&gt;Sun
Shining. &lt;font color='olive' size='3'&gt;Go Caching.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color='orange' size='3'&gt;Be Smiling!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color='navy' size='2'&gt;Congrats on finding 1,234 caches. I
look forward to finding your hides and the way your puzzles
challenge my way of thinking. One can see the emotion of your cache
hunt while reading your logs. I am grateful that you will lend a
hand on those tough hides. I hope to see you on the trails soon.
Congrats again!!&lt;br /&gt;
Valsey&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color='olive' size='2'&gt;The first time I met LabguyMN, we went
ice fishing. It was so cold and we fished in the middle of a
blizzard. His ice house was maybe 20 feet from ours and I couldn't
even see him. We toughed it out. But nobody else was on the lake..
hmmm imagine that!! Then as we packed up and tried to walk back
into shore amongst the huge snow drifts, he shares that he needs to
get a cache today. Go figure!!! So needless to say we got to the
beach, got to the GZ and dug out about 4' snow drift around this
garbage can. And lo and behold we found him a cache for a day. What
a trooper!! It's been great to get to know him as a cacher and as a
friend. See you caching and fishing!! DANANDTINA05&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">There are always 2 paths to get to a cache. One of them leads on a straight line though (or into if you are lucky) the stream, then up a sheer muddy hill, through the trees and then finally to GZ and the pleasure of making a good find. The other path is a nicely groomed trail that lazily curves from point A to point B which is 6 feet from the cache.

I'll give you 3 guesses (and the first two don't count) which of these paths 3humphs and I took to show the TV camera guy about Geocaching... Let's just say Mark and I both have wet and muddy shoes.

Dropped a WestSideDaddy path tag.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache is located in M. B. Johnson Park, in north Moorhead. The cache will not be hard to find; we have rated it a 2.5 due to having to have traveled to qualify for this cache. Be sure to bring a writer, as you will not find one in the cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">To claim a Find for this cache you will need to have done some ghost chasing, find some virtual caches. Virtual caches are no longer being created, what we have is what we have. If you want to find a virtual cache the nearest one is Uncle John’s over near Horace.

     It turns out that cachers are not the only ones finding ghosts. In England there is a group called The Ghostfinder Paranormal Society (GPS for short and I did not make up the nickname). Their website says they are the United Kingdom’s leading paranormal investigation society. The group was started in 2007, four years ago.

     To qualify for a find on this cache you must have found at least one virtual cache for every year the Ghostfinder Paranormal Society has been around. That means in 2011 four virtuals are needed to qualify, in 2012 five will be needed, and so on and so on. The cache will be a bit harder to get each year, and remember no new virtuals are being placed.

     Virtual caches have a tendency to take us to interesting places and if you are in a new town or state but don’t have time to hunt for a physical cache, a virtual may be just the thing. If you like virtual caches you may want to look into finding Waypoints.


First to Find honors go to hintoner and their geopup. Congratulations!</groundspeak:long_description>

The park is often visited by people running their dogs or working on their golf swing.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a Challenge cache; to log a find for this cache you must be an EarthCache Master. It does not matter if you are Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum, as long as you are a Master EarthCacher you are qualified to make the find on this cache. To become an EarthCache Master you must visit and log three or more EarthCaches in two or more states or countries. If you are not a Master EarthCacher you can find more information at EarthCache.org http://www.earthcache.org/  This is also the site to find the EarthCache Masters Application Form (click on the 'EarthCache
Masters' link on the left side of the page).


M.B. Johnson Park is bordered to the north and west by the Red River. With the park located where it is, it has three EarthCaches within 4.5 miles, two in North Dakota and one in Minnesota. These caches and a few hours of learning about the geography and geology of the Red River Valley would qualify even a new EarthCacher for Master status, and this challenge. However, any three, or more, caches in at least two states/countries will do; so if you are ready, the cache is waiting.

Unless you've been living in a cave for the past few months, you
most certainly know about Boreal Walker's &lt;a href=
"http://coord.info/GC2P5TJ"&gt;Periodic Table of Elements
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, where you have to find 118 different caches, each of
which has the name of a different element on the Periodic Table of
Elements in its title.&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds simple enough, except that
some of these elements are pretty obscure and don't show up often
in cache names.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take for example, &lt;a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadtium"&gt;Darmstadtium&lt;/a&gt;, named
after the German city of &lt;a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadt"&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;, where the
element was discovered in 1994. The &lt;a href=
"http://coord.info/GC1QG6W"&gt;only cache in the world&lt;/a&gt; with this
element in its name is about 8,000 miles north of the Twin
Cities.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But not any more. Darmstadtium. Now available in a city
near you. You know you want some. Come get some.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div align="left" class="White"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="sans"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As always, use caution when caching and stay within your comfort
zone. Be careful, and have fun!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

I saw this one get listed and then saw the DNFs earlier today so I decided to head over to the area and see what I could find. I made the walk and got to grand zero and started looking. A few minutes later Khoda join me at ground zero and we both started looking in earnest. As Khoda found his footing I spotted the container and quickly we had it in hand. I suppose now, I will have to start working on the challenge. Thanks for the cache and a great adventure.

Showed up at GZ right behind Khoda. We looked and looked. The another cacher. And we all looked and looked. Khoda left and I was just about to give up when the find was made (not by me). Thanks for sharing FTF.

Container was located about 75 feet north of where our general consensus of GZ was.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;So today is my birthday and my Dad, psubrian, really wanted to
do something special for him. I twisted his arm, pulled his leg,
and begged and pleaded that we start a tradition of hiding a
geocache on my birthday every year.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;But since I'm just turning one, it can't be that hard - it has
to be an easy hide. I promise that next year when I turn 2, it'll
get harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the FTF, there will be a $1 bill (in honor of me turning 1).
Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than cancelling it, I figured we can still get together and trade some stories and travelers, and maybe hit some of the geocaches in the Northern suburbs.

Driving back from the lake when I saw this listing get posted. Looked at the location and it was on the route home. Was pleased to see it was still unfound when we got nearer (at least nothing logged).

Made the stop and were looking around and right as we were about to make the find, another crew showed up so we all shared in the FTF glory.

After a long assent through base camp one and base camp two we finally reached the peak and started looking for the cache. After several false starts (and a few stern discussions about what "Hold the flashlight and point it here" means) we made the cache and planted our flag on the blank log sheet. Thanks for a great bit of timing and a great cache.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Old marble-eye. About four million pounds of walleye are taken from Minnesota lakes and rivers each year. From the shore, in the boat or on the ice, a lot of hours are put into a good meal, a memorable story or maybe even a new state record. The current record is 17 pounds, 8 ounces; 35.8 inches. That walleye was taken out of Seagull River 13 May 1979. 

What kind of cache would be good for a keeper? You'll have to do some caching to find out what our thoughts are on the matter.

You are looking for a large container. Plenty of room for trade items and even large size trackables. There is room for pens, but they don't do well in the cold around here, so be sure to bring something to write with.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;A special cache for a special cacher!! Look
for a commemorative ammo can filled with fun geocaching
tschotskes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We were going to make
this a traditional cache, but then we realized that since this was
seeingitdifferent, we simply had to make it a puzzle. Since we
already made a very very difficult puzzle for him a while ago, we
decided to be especially nice and make a very very simple
puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Consider it a white dove of
peace offering, if you will, and the nice thing about this is that
it will make him feel extra guilty the next time he decides to hide
a nano in a swamp.&lt;br /&gt;
So here you are, to find seeingitdifferent's tribute
cache&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NORTH 45 04.xxx&lt;br /&gt;
To find xxx, do the following: 1. What find is this of
seeingitdifferent's? Take that number and subtract 1578.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEST 93 28.yyy&lt;br /&gt;
To find yyy, do the following: 1. What find is this of
seeingitdifferent's? Take that number and subtract 1338.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;There you go. We didn't want to make this insanely easy, so
we decided to do this puzzle King Boreas style. In other words, no
geochecker! Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="navy"&gt;The thing that I admire most
about SID is that deep down inside he is one of the most kind and
caring people I know. You might not know that if you've spent hours
combing pine trees or dismantling bleachers while looking for one
of his EVIL hides, but trust me, you won't find a better human
being or friend. The world need's more people like SID! Oh, yeah,
he's also an awesome cacher too. Hard finds, puzzles, earthcaches,
whatever. He gets them all. About the only thing he shies away from
is "easy" hides. Just look at the average cache difficulty rating
for his finds. It's the highest I've ever seen, sitting right near
2.00. That's insane! Most people are around 1.7. Anyway, good luck
on your next 2,000! Thanks for being a great friend! And now that
I've written all this complimentary stuff, do you think I could get
a hint on CacheTributes "Evil" Twin?&lt;br /&gt;
Mike (SharknoseBunnies)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border="10" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" bordercolor=
"blue"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;We first encountered
seeingitdifferent about a month after we started caching. He had a
number of puzzles near JJ's work, and we emailed him with a couple
of questions. He was instantly kind, friendly, and gave us some
advice that we did not heed: "run, run away from the puzzles!" In
the past year we have had the honor and privilege of caching with,
solving puzzles with, hanging out with, and occasionally teasing
SID. He's a quality person, and a good friend. Here's to his
2,000th find, and may he have many more!&lt;br /&gt;
Jim (JJnTJ)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border="10" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" bordercolor=
"red"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="navy"&gt;Seeingitdifferent lives up to
his name. Anytime you're stumped on a puzzle or hide, his unique
point of view comes to the rescue. But more than that, he's great
at getting people motivated. Who else could convince a few dozen
people to go and not find a cache together? Just don't get him near
any ticks; I think they're his Kryptonite.&lt;br /&gt;
Shawn (SPStanley)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border="10" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" bordercolor=
"blue"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;I remember when SID used to
make fun of me when he'd catch me planning out my day's geocaching
route. He didn't understand the allure of geoaching, so when I
received a friend request from him, I thought for sure it had to be
a prank!!! But it wasn't....he was hooked on the puzzles and boy
did he dive into understanding those. His enthusiam and
appreciation of solving puzzle was contagious and now I see puzzles
just a bit differently.&lt;br /&gt;
Congrats on #2000!&lt;br /&gt;
Mary (maryufaust)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border="10" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" bordercolor=
"red"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="navy"&gt;SID is not so much a
geocacher as he is a force of nature. If you need somebody to get
the word out about something, he's your man. He has the entire
Minnesota geocaching community on speed dial, as well as 60% of the
Northern Illinois geocaching community and 20% of the geocaching
community of southern Slovenia. I'm still not sure how he managed
that last one. If you're stranded on lifeboat and your shipmates
are trying to decide which person will be that evening's dinner,
he's the one you want to have on your side. Through sheer power of
will, he is able to convince people that a trip in a leaky canoe
down water moccasin-infested rapids is a perfectly sensible thing
to do. Word on the street is that it took him this long to get to
2,000 finds because he was too busy rescuing children from burning
orphanages before giving them fabulous financing deals. I'm looking
forward to his next 2,000 finds knowing that the world will
definitely be a more interesting place. Congrats, SID!&lt;br /&gt;
Mike (sparkyfry)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;What can I say about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=

"color: #f00"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (that is consumable by the masses)?
He&amp;#8217;s a freak the likes of which are rarely seen.&amp;nbsp;
He&amp;#8217;s part of the historic quintet: Nessie, Sasquatch,
Leprechauns, Chupacabra and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #00f"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #008000"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #f00"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I have to admit that
he&amp;#8217;s the reason I have had my share of time at &lt;span style=
"color: #00f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evil Pine Trees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Godforsaken
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800080"&gt;bleachers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and
hours spent at a computer pounding my head on the keyboard in an
attempt to solve his puzzles.&amp;nbsp; I decided that &amp;#8216;&lt;em&gt;in
order to conquer the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #00f"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #008000"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #f00"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I have to learn to think like a
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #00f"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #008000"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #f00"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. And, whenever possible, to look
like one. I've gotta get inside this guy's pelt and crawl around
for a few days&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt;- I said to myself.&amp;nbsp; So I decided to
take up hockey. Also I have invested in a medieval rack- I think
I&amp;#8217;ve gotten 1/16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of an inch taller already and
am up to 5&amp;#8217;8 3/16&amp;#8221;!&amp;nbsp; Also I bought a boat and am
looking seriously at a new Honda Odyssey Touring Elite.&amp;nbsp; But
really his profile page says it all:&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8220;I feel
&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m&lt;/em&gt; what Geocaching is about. Playing the Game on
&lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; terms, &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; way. &lt;em&gt;Judging&lt;/em&gt; others while
hopefully not being judged by others. If you are looking at any of
my puzzles and need some help just drop me an email and I would be
glad to &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8216;bwa-ha-ha-ha&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt; at you and bring you
Dilly Bars while I watch you search!&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; But I&amp;#8217;m
paraphrasing and may have embellished a little bit there but I
think the message is still pure.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;To be sure &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #00f"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #008000"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #f00"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; elevates our sport from the
sometimes nerdy, Dungeons and Dragons-esque state of affairs in
which we find ourselves to a level of coolness previously only
attained by college athletes, rock stars, and reality tv stars- and
for that we thank him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t wordsmith &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #00f"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #008000"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #f00"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8217;s mantra: "Play it your way
and on your terms. Always be supportive of other cachers and help
other cachers to keep having fun."&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;He does all 3 with class.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Thanks for all the fun and for
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #00f"&gt;Seeing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
"color: #008000"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=

&lt;table border="10" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" bordercolor=
"red"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="navy"&gt;I, like many in the northwest
metro area, met SID as he was walking away from signing the FTF
log. Since that time I have gotten to know him better. Shared a few
ftf's and laughs and drilled some holes in the ice. Congratulations
SID. Thanks for all your great caches.&lt;br /&gt;
Mark (3Humphs)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border="10" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" bordercolor=
"blue"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;I first met SID when he was
looking for a cache of mine called &amp;#8220;Put Me In Coach&amp;#8221;.
Another cacher had placed a KB 2000 coin in the cache, and SID was
having trouble finding it so he asked for a hint. SID has gone from
coin hound to evil cache hound to puzzle hound to earth cache hound
to FTF hound to hound hound and beyond through out his caching
career. I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed the daily updates he provides, the ideas
for new caches he tosses around, and the occasional time in the
field we&amp;#8217;ve spent together. When he first started caching, he
called me his mentor and I called him my stalker. Today I call him
a friend and he just calls and calls and calls.&lt;br /&gt;
Willis (RudeRat)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border="10" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" bordercolor=
"red"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="navy"&gt;Congratulations to SID on
reaching the 2,000 milestone! What an accomplishment - especially
with 25% of those finds being puzzles! Thanks, SID, for all of the
caches and challenging puzzles that you have placed to give back to
this great sport too!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;SID &amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t even
know where to begin. We all know how much he enjoys talking and
consequently, I have enough material on him to write a whole book!
I&amp;#8217;m not sure he even knows (until he reads this) that he was
my original nemesis when I first started chasing FTFs. Every single
time I made a run for a cache, I&amp;#8217;d see SID signed at the top
of the log. My loving wife, SupportVehicle, even proudly proclaimed
him as my #1 nemesis and it was her mission to help me beat him out
on FTFs, thus how she earned her name. Well, SID and I finally met
up one day in early summer of 2010 and much to my disappointment he
actually turned out to be a pretty nice guy. To show how nice of a
guy he is, I now am very proud to call SID a good friend and
someone that I can count on calling me up at 11pm on a Saturday
night, asking what I&amp;#8217;m doing, and next thing I know I&amp;#8217;m
with him in Saint Paul chasing down some bus stops in January and
not getting home until 3am. I cannot even begin to think of how
many of my own finds have been with SID along &amp;#8211; from trips to
Cannon Falls to driving randomly around Roseville and Rosemount
chasing puzzles. Heck, he even dragged me out to the middle of the
same lake twice &amp;#8211; once when it was frozen and again in the
middle of a tropical storm all just to revenge a DNF. SID,
congratulations on 2,000 &amp;#8211; I cannot wait to find the next
2,000 with you!&lt;br /&gt;
Brian (psubrian)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

I remember that when I found it, I had found about 30 caches and thought that was quite a few. A minute later the Wednesday night Caching Crew came by and since then my life has been a lot more exciting.
So, come and find my new cache in an old place.

Asked West Side Momma if she thought she could take it out when the timer went of and when I told her why, she rolled her eyes and said OK. Quick drive over and then I heard some people in the woods and what did I discover. A pack of geocachers in the trees. A quick co-ftf with Mrs S and SNB.

Bring a flashlight</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We have been sorely lacking in the geocaching department this year so we decided to go all out and host an event. Hope to see you there.

We spend lots of time wandering around Pennsylvania Woods in the dark and have seen many an eerie thing lurking in the shadows. So what a great place to have a nighttime geocache get together.  We will meet at the posted coordinates for a spooky Matildamay/Hollyberrie style scavenger hunt through the woods.  You just know that means fun! There may be a tree or two on the paths but mostly it is an easy hike. 

Snacks, hot cocoa and prizes provided

Dress for the weather, bring your best flashlight, GPS, and geo-friends.   

The City of Golden Valley has asked that we park on the west side – 23rd Ave &amp; Rhode Island</groundspeak:long_description>

Inviting some non-caching friends to join us and we had a blast with the scavenger hunt. I was really the most clever idea I have seen. Kids and adults alike all had a great time. Thanks for a wonderful event.</groundspeak:text>

Of all the higher end machining that we've done in industry we came up with this name regarding tough home projects.  The worst I have encountered are swing sets for the kids.  Bad instructions (when read), missing parts, and extra parts when you really start to wonder if it is going to function when you get the project done.

After heading down the wrong side of the bog, marsh, swamp, whatever, and heading back and getting on the correct side I quickly decided that this was the best time to find this one. In the summer... well maybe the mosquitos could carry you, in the winter, well bring a shovel. Using the downed trees to my advantage I quickly found GZ and not so quickly made the find. Just glad I was able to find my way back home. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Reeling from my successful find of Mechanical Nightmare (http://coord.info/GC35GV6) I decided I had better go for this one as well. Along the way I saw 2 big deer, well, actually they saw me first and high (white) tailed it out of there. I saw a slim trail of land to cross the reeds on and quickly found myself AGAIN on the wrong side. Made the large loop around to GZ and made the find. Managed to lose the tip off my walking stick, but also discovered that the rubber tip was hiding a sharp ice tip (or a good stabby tip if I run into a bear). All in all a great walk in the woods. Thanks for a great location.</groundspeak:text>

Wandered around for a while, looking here and there and then adjusted my search using the coords from sparky. Still wandered around a little bit before looking at the clue. After a quick "a ha" moment had the cache in hand. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;I love lemon meringue pie. Too bad it doesn't love me.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Lemon Filling:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;4 egg yolks (reserve whites for
meringue)&lt;br /&gt;
1/3 cup cornstarch&lt;br /&gt;
1 1/2 cups water&lt;br /&gt;
1 1/3 cups sugar&lt;br /&gt;
1/4 teaspoon salt&lt;br /&gt;
3 tablespoons butter&lt;br /&gt;
1/2 cup lemon juice&lt;br /&gt;
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1 (9-inch) pre-baked pie shell&lt;br /&gt;
1 recipe Meringue, recipe follows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjust the oven rack to the middle position. Preheat oven to 375
degrees F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whisk egg yolks in medium size mixing bowl and set aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a medium saucepan, combine cornstarch, water, sugar, and
salt. Whisk to combine. Turn heat on medium and, stirring
frequently, bring mixture to a boil. Boil for 1 minute. Remove from
heat and gradually, 1 whisk-full at a time, add hot mixture to egg
yolks and stir until you have added at least half of the
mixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return egg mixture to saucepan, turn heat down to low andcook,
stirring constantly, for 1 more minute. Remove from heat and gently
stir in butter, lemon juice, and zest until well combined. Pour
mixture into pie shell and top with meringue while filling is still
hot. Make sure meringue completely covers filling and that it goes
right up to the edge of the crust. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or
until meringue is golden. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.
Make sure pie is cooled completely before slicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meringue Topping:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;4 egg whites&lt;br /&gt;
1 pinch cream of tartar&lt;br /&gt;
2 tablespoons sugar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Place egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer
fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat egg whites until soft peaks
form and then gradually add sugar and continue beating until stiff
peaks form, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Use to top lemon filling.
&lt;p&gt;Yield: topping for 1 (9-inch) pie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To find your slice:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine ingredients and divide as below:&lt;br /&gt;
N 44 5 (9694315 / &lt;font color="blue"&gt;lemon filling&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;

Approached from the road and scared the ducks pretty well. Figured out where the cache had to be and finally made the find. Thanks for the puzzle and cache.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color="#FF3366"&gt;I've known Ms Sunshine for over 25 years -
through college, marriage, kids &amp;amp; work. We have our regular
Tuesday afternoon (well, really evening) "meeting" - we used to
just play cribbage, but now instead, we solve geocache puzzles. Ms
Sunshine and I first heard about geocaching from her son, Oliver.
We thought he was making up stories about finding coins in little
containers all over the Twin Cities, some even from as far away as
Germany! Fast forward a year later, when I took Ms Sunshine out on
the Luce line and we found her first cache. Within months, she had
passed my finds, and then this spring, got the FTF bug. Things
haven't been the same since- no matter where we are, it seems that
a newly published cache is "right around the corner"; even if that
corner is 20 miles away. She is constantly pushing me to the edge
and forcing me to face my fears--- she may even get me out on the
middle of a frozen lake yet! Thanks for being a great friend, and
my favorite caching partner! Congrats on your 1000th cache, I look
forward to many thousand more!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="#FF3366"&gt;Kathleen &amp;gt;^..^&amp;lt;
proutkat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="#3333FF"&gt;Laura is great to geocache with, because she
is never impatient when a bunch of kids are caching with her, and
she doesn't seem to mind when we find them before she even gets
close. I remember once we went geocaching in the freezing cold,
doing a multi-cache. We found a fake duck in a tree and it really
scared us!! Another time we found a really neat crow cache. She had
already found it but wanted me to see a really cool cache, so off
we went in the dark. I'm glad I went, and always have fun when we
cache!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="#3333FF"&gt;Kelly
(Aquabugg)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="#660066"&gt;When I go geocaching, its not for the actual
activity itself, its because I enjoy spending time with my mother
and laura together. I go with them and they drag me all over the
place, searching in rain or shine. If I say I'll go with them for
one geocache, it always ends up being at least ten. I have to climb
trees for them when they can't. Once, very recently, I tried to
climb a tree for them and ended up falling down and on the way down
I tried to grab onto the tree, and ended up scratching my stomach.
Don't worry though, we got the cache! We almost always do. When I'm
100 and I look back and think of Laura, I hope all the fond
memories I have with her are of us geocaching.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="#660066"&gt;Jamie
(PinkHairBandGeek)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="#008080"&gt;I first met Ms.Sunshine (and proutkat) at her
Sunshine Factory. Well it might not be her's, but it was a fun
time. Since then I've had the pleasure of finding a few caches with
her. (Like a hundred in one day.) It was great! We signed the logs
as Sun Zoo. She was the Sun, we (The Camel, The Kat and The Lab)
were the Zoo. Congrats on your 1000th find! And also on your
ongoing streak.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=
"#008080"&gt;Mark~3Humphs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="green"&gt;I've only known Ms Sunshine for a short time,
as I've only been caching for a short time, but she welcomed me
along on various caching outings as if we'd known each other for
years. She is always super nice to talk to and always up for
anything. I'm very happy to have made a geo-friend in her.
Congratulations on 1,000 and here's to the next 1,000!!!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;Lisa of
RyanLisaKayla&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="#FF6600"&gt;Ms Sunshine is a cacher that provides
competition even while being happy!! She is an FTF hound that
competes with other west metro cachers for an FTF! She always says
very nice things in her logs!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="#FF6600"&gt;Angel In Out
Field&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="#8B0000"&gt;I met Ms Sunshine when I'd just leaped down
from a tree. She and proutkat walked into the clearing just at that
moment, and we made our way to a couple caches after that. From
that point forward, I saw her name everywhere as she and proutkat
stormed the west metro and made many FTFs. Ms Sunshine is a great
PAF and we've made some fun finds together. I look forward to many
more. Congrats, Ms Sunshine!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=
"#8B0000"&gt;SPStanley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="#0066CC"&gt;Ms. Sunshine is always so pleasant and well,
sunny! What a fitting caching name she's picked. I've really
enjoyed the times I've gotten to cache with her, and I look forward
to more. It's been great to see her and proutkat out caching at all
hours of the day and night, racking up FTFs, and having a lot of
fun doing it. Congrats on 1,000, and good luck on the next
grand!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="#0066CC"&gt;Sharknose
Bunnies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="#4B0082"&gt;Ms Sunshine is such a dedicated cacher that
she will drive around on FTF run despite a car filled with feline
feces. This makes me proud, since I feel like I indirectly got her
started on caching via proutkat. Her puzzle solving and puzzle
creating acumen is also nothing to sneeze at. I'm a particular fan
of her music puzzles. Congrats on a quick 1,000 finds, Ms Sunshine,
and here's to the next 1,000! Keep those music puzzles
coming!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="#4B0082"&gt;&lt;font color=
"#4B0082"&gt;sparkyfry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;-------------------&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="#4B0082"&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt;Ahhh Ms. Sunshine. I
first noticed this new cacher gobbling up all the nearby FTFs with
Proutkat. I quickly took notice that these two were a force to be
reckoned with. An area where one could take their time to collect
an easy FTF now had a sense of urgency. One day I finally met her
and instantly liked her. She has a great sense of humor and anyone
can tell that she really enjoys geocaching. Her caching name just
brings a smile to my face. Ms. Sunshine, Ms. Sunshine, Ms.
Sunshine. See what I mean... Keep having a blast and Congrats on
hitting 1,000!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="#4B0082"&gt;&lt;font color=

Sitting at home, looking forward to a nice weekend and I kept hearing the special ding of newly published caches. 7 miles, 10 miles, 8 miles.... too far.. .6 miles.... you know we have to get that one. Got to ground zero and quickly joined in the party with mnfishnutz and gpcat. It was nice to finally meet you. Thanks for the cache even if it was in a spot I was going to use ;)

"font-size: 16px;"&gt;This cache along with 5 others was published for
a mngca (Minnesota Geocachers Association) weeknight caching event.
During these events the last person to find the cache of the group
gets to sign. For the people who may be slower at finding the cache
than the rest, this cache is for you! The person who has the most
last to finds on the night gets a special prize from this cache as
well as the prize of getting to name this cache. The cache is a big
plastic jar with lots of room for SWAG and trackables. The winner
of the losers (or last to finders) was RudeRat who won the drawing
at Red Rooster. He declared the cache be named Following Red_Devil
who beat him to finding this cache by a matter of seconds which
made his eligible for being the last to find champ. After seeing
her disappointment at not getting to name the cache (she had one
last to find on the night) and the earlier story, he named it
Following Red_Devil. Enjoy and please return as
found!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"font-size: 16px;"&gt;Another cache along the Luce Line Trail. The
Luce Line, or the Electric Short Line Railway as it was originally
called, was the brain child of Colonel William Luce early in the
20th Century. It was originally created to transport passangers as
well as farm goods by train throughout the western suburbs of
Minneapolis. Soon, however, with the invention of cars, freight
transportation became the sole purpose for the line. It eventually
could no longer compete with the efficiency of trucks and was
closed in the late 1960s. It was soon purchased by the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources and was converted into a trail
system. It served its community for more than 50 years as a railway
and now almost 40 more years as a trailway. Come enjoy walking
where the Iron Horse once ran.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Shopped the morning away and need a break?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Want nothing to do with shopping but want out&lt;br /&gt;
of the house after the holiday?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Come on out and join fellow geocachers for&lt;br /&gt;
a "Cup of Joe"&lt;br /&gt;
This will be a great time to meet and greet other cachers, pickup
tips if you're new to caching or&lt;br /&gt;
just swap tall tales over a cup of joe!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bring some trackables&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache replaces &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC1BCMW"&gt;Strolling
Around Duck Pound&lt;/a&gt;, which met an untimely end. As near as I can
tell, the official name of the body of water across the street is
in fact "Duck Pond" (replete with capital letters), as opposed to
something like "the duck pond."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A while back, the banks along a creek flowing into Duck Pond
eroded, turning Duck Pond into what the city described as "a mud
pit" that polluted a nearby lake. Fortunately, the city recently
dredged Duck Pond so you can enjoy it in its newfound pristine
splendor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My interest in Duck Pond stems from the fact that I grew up about
half a mile away from it. When I was a toddler, I fell into Duck
Pond and was rescued by my mom -- a no doubt highly unpleasant
experience for her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't forget to say hi to the ducks!

Thanks for the cache.

&lt;p class="style2"&gt;Golden Valley's most prolific cacher is back in

He has found his 4,999 cache, and this will be #5,000. With this
achievement, he becomes only the 40th Minnesotan to reach this
milestone of dedication, thrills, and skill. Congrats on the
milestone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We would address this note of congratulations to Mike but that
would include half of the western suburb geocachers. Suffice it to
say that Sparkyfry-of-Golden-Valley is a geocacher that rarely has
bad days. He's always got a smile waiting to be displayed and a
self-depricating story of a cache adventure gone awry. He's the
main reason that geocachers should we airbags. We're proud to call
you a friend (though you continually deny our friend requests) and
happy to see you achieve this milestone. 5000 finds is a lot. We're
just wondering, how come your log page only has you credited with
500 finds?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.5695671974740641"&gt;I sat down
to write a Haiku to honor sparkyfry, and soon realized that 17
syllables was not enough for a person of my verbose nature to say
what I wanted. &amp;nbsp;Mike was one of the first cachers I met
&amp;#8220;in the wild.&amp;#8221; &amp;nbsp;He was very encouraging to me as a
newbie, and I have since seen him offer that same encouragement to
other cachers, old and new. &amp;nbsp;He is always willing to share an
FTF or a puzzle hint, and &amp;nbsp;has made some amazing finds at all
levels of difficulty and terrain. &amp;nbsp;He has hosted events, even
a CITO one. &amp;nbsp;Sparkyfry does this all while working full time,
serving the community of Golden Valley, and being a husband to his
awesome wife and a devoted dad to Rose Duffy, the supporting
actress in many of his music videos. &amp;nbsp;Way to go, Sparkyfry!
&amp;nbsp;Congratulations!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So...no Haiku, but this kept going through my head... (think
Schneidermans...)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sparkyfry, &amp;nbsp;Sparkyfry, &amp;nbsp;FTF hound.&lt;br /&gt;
Sparkyfry, Sparkyfry, 5,000 found...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've shared many an adventure with sparkyfry, including
searching in questionable locations for rare elements and, well,
tree climbing. &amp;nbsp;He brings a great mix of talent, creativity
and common sense to the geocaching world, except maybe when he's
creating craters. &amp;nbsp;Congrats on 5000!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Ode to a Cacher who's name is Sparkyfry&lt;br /&gt;
I consider him a great friend and one heck of a guy&lt;br /&gt;
His array of accomplishments are vast and abundant&lt;br /&gt;
Starting with Challenges that are nearing two hundred&lt;br /&gt;
Then there are puzzles both created and found&lt;br /&gt;
That express his great knowledge and help him to be a great
hound&lt;br /&gt;
Today he is hitting finds of 5000&lt;br /&gt;
Worthy of Tribute and loads of fanfair&lt;br /&gt;
May the next 5000 finds be filled with the same joy&lt;br /&gt;
That you had reaching this Milestone each and every day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats on 5,000!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raccoon hats off to the man of the hour &amp;#8211; Sparkyfry! It
seems like it was just a few weeks ago when I was logging his
2000th tribute and then days later, I was with him on an epic
caching adventure when he celebrated #4000 with some peanut butter
jar in a retaining wall. Later that day he almost died on a FTF
chase down a steep embankment when he lost his footing and almost
impaled himself on the train tracks. Did that stop sparkyfry? No
way &amp;#8230; he just kept hobbling along that day for 150+ caches
across 3 states &amp;#8211; simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just looking back at my FTF logs and realized that
sparkyfry has been involved in almost half of them &amp;#8211; and a
number of them come with good stories and fun times. And I will be
forever grateful that he was there to witness firsthand my
legitimate &amp;#8216;V&amp;#8217; FTF. I cannot wait to see what our next
adventure together will be and I&amp;#8217;m proud to be able to call
sparkyfry a friend. Congratulations on not only finding 5000 pieces
of Tupperware in the woods with million dollar satellites, but
doing it with dignity and class and maintaining that healthy
balance between family, community, work and hobby! We&amp;#8217;ll
start planning your 10,000 tribute for next spring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I am still waiting to see these Olympic Geocaching
Medals that I keep hearing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

So tonight (tonight),&lt;br /&gt;
Tonight,&lt;br /&gt;
Celebrate Sparkyfry (celebrate Sparkyfry).&lt;br /&gt;
He's found 5,000.&lt;br /&gt;
And fallen off a mountain.&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;#8217;s an box,&lt;br /&gt;
full of mostly wacky swag&lt;br /&gt;
So tonight (tonight),&lt;br /&gt;
Celebrate Sparkyfry!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparkyfry&amp;#8217;s caches were some of the first we found when we
started geocaching. After meeting him on the trail we learned that
we had known him vicariously for a long time. In conversations with
him, it turns out that the female half of our team had worked with
his mom, he had played piano in the concert band in which our son
is a member and we read his name in a Golden Valley newsletter
while doing some research on a cache we were developing on the
history of Golden Valley. It was then that we discovered he was
working on a cache on this very same theme! This series of
coincidences has carved a special fondness for him and we are
always happy to read his great log narratives when he visits our
caches. We&amp;#8217;re even happier when we meet up with him on the
FTF trail. We admire his ability to create intriguing puzzles and
his skill at solving those of others, his devotion to his very cute
daughter, Rose Duffy, and his dedication to the geocaching sport.
Congratulations Mike on reaching this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on your 5000th find Sparkyfry. When I first
started caching one of my first finds, after three or four times
looking, was Baby Sparkyfry. I read the cache page and wondered who
is this Sparkyfry guy. It wasn't long afterwards when I was asking
you for help on one of your puzzles. We met face to face at a cache
soon after that and I can honestly say that the help and guidance
you gave me made me into the geocacher I am today. Now I am not
sure if that is good or bad but it is the truth. Keep up the good
caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first met Mike about 70 miles from the Twin Cities, and
watched from a distance as he and another cacher looked for a
geocache. It intrigued me, so I went outside and began asking the
typical muggle questions. Mike described the process and said the
hint was &amp;#8220;one of these things is not like the other&amp;#8221;, I
looked down and saw a fake rock - wow, what a great feeling,
finding a cache! (beginner&amp;#8217;s luck?) After signing the log, I
went about my merry way, and back in the Twin Cities, I started
caching a bit here and there with my kids, and my good friend
Laura.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We began recognizing names in the logs, and &amp;#8220;sparkyfry&amp;#8221;
was one of them. Laura and I started on the FTF trail last April,
and at our second ever FTF, we were signing the log, when across
the field sprinted someone, who yelled out &amp;#8220;hey, did you find
it yet?&amp;#8221; After we all signed the log, &amp;amp; celebrated our
FTF, we exchanged stories, realizing in the process that it was
Mike who I had met at that very first geocache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Strange coincidence? I think not, as Mike-aka-Sparkyfry is one of
the friendliest geocachers I&amp;#8217;ve met. Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t
know how he does it, balancing a FT job, service to Golden Valley,
as well as being a dedicated husband and father. On the FTF trail,
I&amp;#8217;ve heard multiple times, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d love to stay and
grab another cache, but I want to get home and tuck Rose into
bed&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; what a great dad!&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks, Mike for introducing me to this great sport of geocaching,
encouraging me and other newbie&amp;#8217;s, sharing FTF&amp;#8217;s,
creating great puzzles, helping me solve puzzles, hosting events,
and sharing your adventures in your fantastic logs and
stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, and btw, that cache at Gustavus? I&amp;#8217;ve been back about 3
times with Ms Sunshine, and I&amp;#8217;ve never found it again&amp;#8230;
Congrats on your 5000! I look forward to hearing about your next
5K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how amazing is Sparkyfry, Golden Valley&amp;#8217;s premier
cacher? Well, here are some true facts about The Most Interesting
Geocacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; His car GPS asks him for directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; Instead of driving, he once jogged five miles to a newly
published cache just to see what Second To Find felt like. It
didn&amp;#8217;t work. He still got the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; MN.Fruitcake asks him if it&amp;#8217;s okay to publish
caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226;&amp;nbsp;His personality is so magnetic that nanos stick to
him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; When he DNF&amp;#8217;s caches&amp;#8212;ha, that&amp;#8217;s a good
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; Caches that have gone missing are so afraid of him that
they return to ground zero on their own so he can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; So he doesn&amp;#8217;t get bored, he caches at
night&amp;#8212;without a flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; 1.5/1.5 caches find him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; He has beaten Khoda to a FTF, and once solved a puzzle
faster than pfalstad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; Cache owners thank him for finding their caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; He can't hold event caches because the largest venue in
Minnesota (the Metrodome) only holds 50,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats on 5,000 caches! See you in another 5,000!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;Enjoy the cache, and please rehide as
found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Let's celebrate the end of the year with a bang (or at least a flash; a flash mob, that is). 

Date: 12-31-11
Time: 12:31 PM (31 minutes after 12-noon)
Where: 2nd floor, South Avenue, overlooking the big amusement park (below the South food court).

On the 2nd floor behind the Lego store, there is a "bridge." Be there between the center light posts at 12:31 for a group picture. Don't be too early, and don't be late; stealth is the name of the game. If you're not sure if you're in the right spot, look for pattenclan and the 4 geo-kids (but not before 12:31). Gather for the group photo facing the Lego store. The camera will be up on the 3rd floor, so the amusement park will be a backdrop. The log will be available immediately after the photo, and you MUST sign the log to sign the online log. 

See ya there!

Please feel free to log an "Attending" log so we have a guess on how many will be coming, but this is not required.

If you have any questions about the location for the flash mob, please contact me. And yes, the photo will be uploaded to GC.com, so by participating you are giving your permission for the photo to be used.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#B40404"&gt;Slap a bow on your gift and if yours is
voted&lt;br /&gt;
the ugliest bow you win a prize!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't have a white elephant sitting at your house.&lt;br /&gt;
No problem! Come along and enjoy the fun&lt;br /&gt;
and meet other cachers and see what new&lt;br /&gt;
treasure they'll be taking home!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy a cup of joe and share tall tales about&lt;br /&gt;
your winter caching adventures and get warmed up&lt;br /&gt;
before going out and trudging through&lt;br /&gt;
the snow looking for those outdoor treasures we&lt;br /&gt;
all seem to enjoy searching for or if you're one&lt;br /&gt;
of the unlucky ones...head to work.&lt;br /&gt;
Come and enjoy a warm cup and some after the holidays
warmth!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Saw the puzzle, gave it a shot and quickly figured out the scheme. Was the first solution on the checker and ran out the door. Got to ground zero and was worried by some fresh tracks. But they went a different direction. Had a little trouble retrieving the container due to some ice, but was able to get it. Was excited to see the nice clean log. Thanks for a nice puzzle and a clever cache.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I saw the notification for the new cache and it was only 4 miles away. I thought I would totally get there in time.... of course that was 4 miles as the crow flies, not through Crystal and Brooklyn Park. Arrived at the area and didn't see the parking lot and wound up parking further away and trudging across the field to it. Go t to ground zero to find Rebelex, Mikedeotis and Alt2statquo already looking for it. A quick find in the end and we had a great third to find party.

Thanks for the cache.

of this name as you will have the best chance of searching without
muggles around if you heed the title of the cache (i.e. come when
it is raining). Easy find but in view of many possible muggles so
please use stealth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And after you find it, then head over to find the other cache in
this park: &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC1T790"&gt;Keep on the
Sunnyside&lt;/a&gt; And if you sing that song, maybe the rain will stop
for the rest of your caching day!? One can only hope...&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache &lt;b&gt;IS AT THE POSTED COORDINATES&lt;/b&gt;; however, because there
are additional logging requirements this cache is classified as a
puzzle. The major requirement is to find, or to have found, in
Minnesota, 31 caches, one for each day of &lt;b&gt;May&lt;/b&gt; according to
the date it was placed. Thus you'll find one that was placed on the
first, one that was placed on the 2nd, and so on.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genesis:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
See the other Minnesota month challenges (Listed Below). May is a
great month to cache because the snow is gone(We Hope) and it's
finally starts to feel like spring. Minnesota is truly a beautiful
place to explore in the early summer, and besides, my
birthday(Berry's) is in May so it was the perfect month to pick for
my entry in this series of caches!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;FAQ:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;What counts and what doesn't?&lt;/i&gt; Caches that have
physical logs, i.e. traditionals, multi's, puzzles, and letterbox
hybrids but not virtuals, events, earthcaches, webcams, or
locationless caches. Furthermore, premium member only and whereigo
caches don't count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How about other months?&lt;/i&gt; Please go ahead and place
a "September Blackout Challenge" or another month that hasn't been
chosen. That would create a total of 12 caches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why just Minnesota?&lt;/i&gt; This challenge is following
the same format as the others already released.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How about Wisconsin?&lt;/i&gt; Go ahead and place a "July
Blackout Challenge - WI". If we did that for each state and each
month we'd have 600 new caches!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How about using find dates rather than placed
dates?&lt;/i&gt; Wow! That'd be 1200 new caches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do prior finds count?&lt;/i&gt; Yes, but that's not as big
of an advantage as it might seem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why's that?&lt;/i&gt; If you just were to find July-placed
caches at random, after a while you would start to duplicate
placement dates. For example, after about 30 finds of July-placed
caches you still would have about eleven to go, after 60 that would
be down to about four; only after 120 would you have half a chance
of finding them all. And multiply those numbers by about 20 to
account for all months and you'd need a couple thousand or so
Minnesota finds to have even half a chance. So most cachers should
have at least a few caches to find.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;What are the logging requirements?&lt;/i&gt; In either
order, you have to find and sign the log at the posted coordinates
and you have to either bookmark or email a list of the GCXXX for
your 31 finds, each of which must have been found and logged by you
personally. After you've done both you may claim the find. Please
try to order your bookmark by July placement date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How can I easily obtain the placements dates of caches
I've found?&lt;/i&gt; One way is to scan the "All Cache Finds" list for
your profile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do I find caches according to their placement
date?&lt;/i&gt;One way is to scan through caches listed for Minnesota.
These are arranged by placement date. You might need to go back
through the years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;What if I've more questions?&lt;/i&gt; Just ask. Anything
significant that's been overlooked will be listed and dated
here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

This one needed a little tender loving care, I pulled a couple magnets from my maintenance box. Should be OK for a while, but needs a little fix up pretty soon. Forgot that there wasn't an exit on the 98th street side and think I spooked the security guard who was sitting in his car when I made 2 loops through the lot.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a great park year round and I thought it deserved a
challenge cache, for just the caches in this park.&lt;br /&gt;
(there is also a "Challenge" on the Geocaching website)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The difficulty rating is for the work involved, not the
hide itself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caches found prior to publish date of this cache do count, they
do not have to be found in same day, so take as long as you want.
Please be safe, and aware of your surroundings while doing this
challenge, because some of these caches are tougher (or impossible)
to find, depending on the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If any of these hides are yours, you only have to find the
other ones.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I missed your name, shoot me an email. (Not that that'll
happen.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Write a note saying you have completed the
challenge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you edited your log, saying you have completed the
challenge, I won't get an email, and I won't know you have done the
whole park.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;...And now Ladies and Gentlemen...The Sands is proud to
present The Man and his music...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out with the family after dinner and decided to go and pick this one up. As usual, we parked 30 feet short and missed access to the trail which takes you 75 feet from the cache and instead bushwacked 280 feet through the soft forest floor and pokey branches. But everyone (including the baby) had a good time. At least until I told them they couldn't log it because it was a challenge and they hadn't found 10 of the other caches in the park yet.

to geocaching about 2 years ago. We just tagged along with them a
few times before getting hooked later on. We've learned a lot about

learn a lot about life from them. They're a couple of good cachers,
but even more, they're a great couple.&lt;br /&gt;

drive it home with one headlight while going through the desert, on
a horse, who I don't think had a name. But we can't dance together,
No we can't talk at all.&lt;br /&gt;

Were on a road to nowhere, and I need you tonight. Because no

of all the education I missed, I want you to want me. All I ask
for, all I pray, a steady rollin' woman gonna come my way. I'm sure

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. Lyrically Speaking Vol.1
was such a crowd pleaser, we knew would have to do a follow up
soon. So when we were approached by LabguyMN, to coLABorate on
another volume, we jumped at the chance. With a puzzle Sensei like
him, it was sure to be a chart topper. This is the hit we came up
with. Written by LabguyMN, produced by 3humphs Studios.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">So being the big male duo we are, we were discussing how hard to
make a puzzle cache and we decided the cachers around here are
pretty smart- like doctors and lawyers and such- but some of them
are like friends in low places (like Labguy) and may look at the
puzzle and say &amp;ldquo;Bye, Bye,Bye&amp;rdquo; before even trying to
solve it. &amp;ldquo;Whose fault would that be?&amp;rdquo; 3humphs
exclaimed and I responded- Blame it on the rain (yea, yea). Well it
got late and when the sun goes down on my side of town I usually
work on puzzles. 3humphs has the same routine and I took one look
at what he&amp;rsquo;d done so far and I told him that&amp;rsquo;s
something to be proud of- but- we&amp;rsquo;d like to know a little bit
about you for our files.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He told me it will take more than common sense so stop your
wondering (whatever that means). The Yellow Moon was now high in
the sky which always makes Mac Daddy Jump, Jump and I needed to go
home. In parting I reminded 3humphs, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t let em pick
guitars and drive them ole trucks.&amp;rdquo; He thanked me and told me
I was 2 Hype and that his Grandpappy told my pappy back in my day
son- a man had to answer for the wicked things he&amp;rsquo;d done.
Clearly he was dreaming so I smacked him once and told him
&amp;ldquo;Wake up Little Susie, WAKE UP!&amp;rdquo; I may have smacked him
too hard as he smacked me back and told me that parents just
don&amp;rsquo;t understand. Actually I may have the story backwards so
don&amp;rsquo;t quote me.&lt;br /&gt;

Some artistic liberties have been taken. One of them is boy band,
and the other one has a rock and roll alter ego. So technically he
could do a digital duo. And another is a brother. But I digressed.

or not?" I told her, "The word is faithful, look it up." Because
now We&amp;rsquo;re just mothers, we&amp;rsquo;re just fathers of teenage
daughters, And if I fall, can you let me down easy? She said to me,
That Hank Williams said it best, a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we got back together I told her, "I wouldn't be a man if
didn't feel like this." Little Miss, said "Do your best." It's just
a little bit of life. She calls me Raymond, and says, "I bet he'd
understand a heart like mine." I said to her, "I wanna see you
again, but I'm stuck in colder weather." Besides, she know's I like
my chicken fried and a cold beer on a Friday night. I'm sorry, I
just can't love you back.&lt;br /&gt;

Bumped up the difficulty, and tweaked it a bit. Setting up a puzzle
has a learning curve to it. This one is proof of that. Drop any
"The". You don't need any, "And The's", either. Don't get caught up
with who may have made it popular and you'll do okay. And Yes Rick,
your right Hank isn't rock. I guess you could say I took some
liberties.</groundspeak:short_description>

Sh-boom.&lt;br /&gt;

Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you, because you're mine... So,
I'll say "good night, sweetheart, good night"... She said, "Johnny,

3rd to solve and FTF goes to Sharknose Bunnies.&lt;br /&gt;

Funny story with this cache. I normally go to a spot one day, and
get coordinates. Than come back the next day to verify those
coordinates, and place the cache. Than I submit for it publication.
Can you guess from the logs which step I missed? Thanks SNB, for
the cache placement. I replaced it with what should have been there
in the first place. I will return your nano to you. You live and
learn I guess.</groundspeak:long_description>

breaking my heart.&lt;br /&gt;
Let's call the whole thing off(You like to-may-toes and I like
to-mah-toes)... I can't live without you if the love is
gone...you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty,pretty, pretty
girl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The road is long, there are no mountains in the way... So stop
dragging my heart around...They say we're young and we don't
know.&lt;br /&gt;
But will it all remain the same?...I remember when you couldn't
wait to love me.&lt;br /&gt;
So tonight I celebrate my love for you...even though you don't
bring me flowers...I have found in you my endless love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I have expanded the accuracy of the geochecker. Since 10 good

&lt;p class="style2"&gt;The other day I was driving around and saw all
this stuff lying by the side of the road, right on the sidewalk!
Man, I thought, the things people leave outside these days. You'd
think in these economic times people would take better care of
stuff. And then I came up with an idea for a puzzle. I thought, I
wonder if people can tell me where I saw all this stuff? Yeah,
that'd make for a cool puzzle! So there you go. Where are these
things? Then go find my cache.&lt;/p&gt;

"http://coord.info/GC2HJJE"&gt;April Challenge - BUSTED&lt;/a&gt; , which
was archived at the request of the E.P. Police Department. Go to
that cache page to read my archive notice. The rules for this cache
are the same as it's predecessor with one exception. For those that
logged the previous April Challenge ... you may log this cache as
well, but you must use a new set of April Cache publications. In
other words, caches used to qualify for my previous cache are NOT
allowed here.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;The April Challenge is out of JAIL. CACHE ON! &lt;img src=
'http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_tongue.gif'
border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Intro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I decided to take up the cause and sponsor one of this series of
monthly challenge caches started by dgauss. As Sharknose Bunnies
said in so many words when publishing the December edition &amp;ldquo;I
want to be left out in the cold&amp;rdquo;! A little muddy, but April
was the best month left. I enjoy caching in the late fall, winter
&amp;amp; early spring. No sweat, no bugs and no itchy plants!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cache &lt;b&gt;IS AT THE POSTED COORDINATES&lt;/b&gt;; however, because there
are additional logging requirements this cache is classified as a
puzzle. The major requirement is to find, or to have found, in
Minnesota, 30 caches, one for each day of &lt;b&gt;April&lt;/b&gt; according to
the date it was placed. Thus you'll find one that was placed on the
first, one that was placed on the 2nd, and so on.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genesis:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See the other Minnesota month challenges (Listed Below). April is a
month of transition from winter to spring. Anything is possible;
including warm sunny days and blizzard snows. It is generally a
good month to cache in the woods, as the ground cover foliage
hasn't started to grow much yet and the only challenge is locating
the caches under wet leaves and patches of snow still left from
winter. Another great month for this series of Minnesota Challenge
caches!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;FAQ:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;What counts and what doesn't?&lt;/i&gt; Caches that have
physical logs, i.e. traditionals, multi's, puzzles, and letterbox
hybrids but not virtuals, events, earthcaches, webcams, or
locationless caches. Furthermore, premium member only and whereigo
caches don't count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How about other months?&lt;/i&gt; Please go ahead and place
a "May Blackout Challenge" or another month that hasn't been
chosen. That would create a total of 12 caches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why just Minnesota?&lt;/i&gt; This challenge is following
the same format as the others already released.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How about Wisconsin?&lt;/i&gt; Go ahead and place a "April
Blackout Challenge - WI". If we did that for each state and each
month we'd have 600 new caches!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How about using find dates rather than placed
dates?&lt;/i&gt; Wow! That'd be 1200 new caches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do prior finds count?&lt;/i&gt; Yes, but that's not as big
of an advantage as it might seem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why's that?&lt;/i&gt; If you just were to find April-placed
caches at random, after a while you would start to duplicate
placement dates. For example, after about 30 finds of April-placed
caches you still would have about eleven to go, after 60 that would
be down to about four; only after 120 would you have half a chance
of finding them all. And multiply those numbers by about 20 to
account for all months and you'd need a couple thousand or so
Minnesota finds to have even half a chance. So most cachers should
have at least a few caches to find.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;What are the logging requirements?&lt;/i&gt; In either
order, you have to find and sign the log at the posted coordinates
and you have to either bookmark or email a list of the GCXXX for
your 30 finds, each of which must have been found and logged by you
personally. After you've done both you may claim the find. Please
try to order your bookmark by April placement date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How can I easily obtain the placements dates of caches
I've found?&lt;/i&gt; One way is to scan the "All Cache Finds" list for
your profile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do I find caches according to their placement
date?&lt;/i&gt;One way is to scan through caches listed for Minnesota.
These are arranged by placement date. You might need to go back
through the years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;What if I've more questions?&lt;/i&gt; Just ask. Anything
significant that's been overlooked will be listed and dated
here.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color='green' size='4'&gt;Team Piker AKA Bob Piker and his

width="200" /&gt; &lt;font color='orange' size='4'&gt;I first met team Piker
when they ask for my help on a multi-cache last year. We have since
cached together and teamed up on one of their 4 way flasher series
hide. They have showed me much kindness and I'm proud to call them
my friends.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob ask me include the following in the long description of the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ammo can was given to Bob (piker) by his daughter and
family (NVTaps) for his 76th birthday. It was the last stage of a 5
stage multi that they hid on his son&amp;rsquo;s (NVgoldfish) property
in Nevada. It was stocked with swag that reminds his two youngest
grandkids of him.&lt;br /&gt;
1. A Bible that reminds them of his belief in Jesus as his
Savior.&lt;br /&gt;
2. A candle that reminds them he trys to let His light shine
through him.&lt;br /&gt;
3. A tape measure for all the Habitat for Humanity and Urban
Homeworks projects he has worked on.&lt;br /&gt;
4. A pin with Bloomington on it for where he lives.&lt;br /&gt;
5. A pin with Buck Hill on it for where he skis and races.&lt;br /&gt;
6. A pin with an apple on it because he was a teacher.&lt;br /&gt;
7. A Mt. Dew can cooler for his favorite drink.&lt;br /&gt;
8. A Sudoku puzzle book for the puzzles he loves to solve.&lt;br /&gt;
9. A deck of cards for the games he loves to play.&lt;br /&gt;
10. A book clip flashlight for all the reading he does. Now the
ammo can is hidden for you to find.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;This Silver Ammo Can has been placed
in the Grand Tradition of honoring those fellow cachers that have
passed the 1,000&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; find milestone.&lt;span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Please honor our friend
&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;Spstanley&lt;/span&gt; for achieving this lofty
goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'&gt;
&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;We knew Shawn would want a real test
for his 1,000th cache, so we have created a most insanely difficult
Twin Cities Geocaching Trivia Quiz &lt;span style=
'color:blue'&gt;Wherigo&lt;/span&gt;! That's right! Be sure to bring all
your smarts and esoteric knowledge of the minute details of a
decade of Twin Cities geocaching if you want to have any hope at
all of finding this cache. Whew! Is this a difficult
quiz!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'&gt;
&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;After you make this find log your
thoughts about our friend, an encounter or meeting you may have had
with him or about some of the numerous hides he has provided for
us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'font-size:14.0pt'&gt;says: &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:13.0pt'&gt;Behind the mellow, laid-back facade of spstanley
lies a brilliant entrepreneur. &amp;nbsp;I had the privilege of
beta-testing his Geocaching app before it hit the market and was
impressed with its ease of use and lack of bugs. &amp;nbsp;I'm not
surprised he was able to navigate the byzantine world of
application submission process. &amp;nbsp;In addition to using his
technical prowess to help solve puzzles, he's also more than
willing to lend a telephonic hand to a frequently hapless cacher
such as myself. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for all you've done for geocaching,
Shawn!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:13.0pt'&gt;Not all of you have had the pleasure of flipping
a canoe in raging rapids and almost dying with spstanley, but I
have. The thing that struck me the most about the whole thing was
how rocky &amp;nbsp;steady the guy was, as we nearly went tumbling to
our deaths. That event, I think, really sums the guy up: calm in
the face of chaos. He is one of the most balanced cachers I know, a
cacher who always seems to squeeze the most fun out of every cache.
He doesn't get caught up in the numbers game, and does the stuff
that seems fun to him, when it seems fun. But that doesn't mean he
hasn't been a force in Twin Cities geocaching. Oh, no! He's got a
bundle of FTFs on tough puzzles, has written a Geocaching
application for and has been known to look for hours for a really
tough hide. Congrats, spstanley, on all the fun you've had caching!

difficult puzzles to exploring Sea Caves in Cannon
Falls.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; One thing about
Spstanley is that when he sets his mind to figuring out something
he sticks with it and eventually does find a solution.&lt;span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; He has become a good friend and
caching partner.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;

'font-size:13.0pt'&gt;&amp;ldquo;I've only cached with Shawn a couple of
times, but thanks to puzzles I've corresponded with him quite a
lot. Whether we're trading hints on each others' puzzles, working
together on someone else's, or it's just me trying to to leech some
of his programming prowess, Shawn has always been helpful and
informative. Here's hoping he switches to the dark side and
develops a Geocaching application for other devices someday! Thanks
for everything, Shawn!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'font-size:13.0pt'&gt;"Spstanley is dashing and daring, courageous and
caring, faithful and friendly, with stories to share.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
All through the forest, he sings out in chorus" ... oh wait, sorry,
I've been watching too many Gummy Bear episodes lately with
psunathan.&amp;nbsp; While many people know spstanley to be soft spoke
and reserved, seeingitdifferent and I got to see another side of
him while caching in Cannon Falls this past winter.&amp;nbsp; He went
all crazy on us trying to find as many letterboxes as he could in
the day.&amp;nbsp; We did everything we could to please him, but it was
just never enough.&amp;nbsp; Finally a 2 year and 5 months old lonely
cache seemed to calm him down and allowed us to get home to our
families in time for dinner.&amp;nbsp; Congratulations on 1,000 and
let's be sure to go get more letterboxes!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Solver.&amp;nbsp; Trees are not liked.&amp;nbsp; Elastic
Yo-yo-arms&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; I first saw
SPStanley when he walked right by my car, and I knew that he was
heading to the newly published cache.&amp;nbsp; I tried to catch up but
he was walking with such determination and speed that it was
hopeless.&amp;nbsp; The gap between us widened, and he disappeared into
the woods.&amp;nbsp; When Ms Sunshine and I arrived at GZ, SPStanley
said he had JUST climbed down from the tree.&amp;nbsp; I did not
believe that ruse for a minute!&amp;nbsp; I believe he was just
pretending that he had climbed the tree and used his super secret
elastic arm to reach up and grab caches from heights
unknown?!&amp;nbsp; How else would he have been able to climb up and
down so quickly?!&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Fast
forward several months, and Ms Sunshine &amp;amp; I were at yet another
newly published cache also placed high in a tree.&amp;nbsp; Who ya
gonna call? SPStanley!&amp;nbsp; He was glad to forgo his duties as
master shed builder in order to assist us and share in the
FTF.&amp;nbsp; This cache was out in the open, so instead of using his
secret weapon, he used some really cool TOTT&amp;rsquo;s, and retrieved
the cache, no need to use his super secret elastic arms.&amp;nbsp; This
was probably for the best; when we opened the log, we found out
that all that work was for an STF!&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"color:darkorange"&gt;Geo Golf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you stroll the park find the perfect spot for your "hole-in-one"
and mark the coordinates on your gps. Once you return from the
fairway, write your coordinates down on your "scorecard" and turn
it in to the scorekeeper. You're hoping to have the closest match
to the coordinates of our virtual "cup". The golfer with the lowest
handicap wins!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

My 3-year-old loved finding the other caches in the area, so we decided to hide a new one. I've seen deer stands in the forest near here so make sure to wear bright clothing in the fall (or just stay out of the woods altogether during hunting season in Wisconsin)!</groundspeak:long_description>
